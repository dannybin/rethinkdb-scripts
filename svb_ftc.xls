Fair Credit Reporting Risk-Based Pricing Regulations
The Board and the Commission are jointly issuing final rules to implement the risk-based pricing provisions in section 311 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The final rules generally require a creditor to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer when the creditor uses a consumer report to grant or extend credit to the consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that creditor. The final rules also provide for two alternative means by which creditors can determine when they are offering credit on material terms that are materially less favorable. The final rules also include certain exceptions to the general rule, including exceptions for creditors that provide a consumer with a disclosure of the consumer's credit score in conjunction with additional information that provides context for the credit score disclosure.

Free Annual File Disclosures
Section 205 of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 requires the Federal Trade Commission to issue a rule to prevent deceptive marketing of free credit reports. To that end, the Commission amends the Free Annual File Disclosures Rule to require certain advertisements for ``free credit reports'' to include prominent disclosures designed to prevent consumers from confusing these ``free'' offers with the federally mandated free annual file disclosures available through the single centralized source. In addition, the final amended Rule requires nationwide consumer reporting agencies to delay advertisements for products and services through the centralized source until after consumers receive their free annual file disclosures, and prohibits other practices that may interfere with the free annual file disclosure process. The final amended Rule also implements certain technical changes to the original Rule.

Fur Products Labeling Act
In December 2010, Congress passed the Truth in Fur Labeling Act (TFLA), which amends the Fur Products Labeling Act (Fur Act) by: (1) Eliminating the Commission's discretion to exempt fur products of relatively small quantity or value from disclosure requirements; and (2) providing that the Fur Act will not apply to certain fur products obtained through trapping or hunting and sold in face to face transactions. TFLA also directs the Commission to review and allow comment on the Fur Products Name Guide (Name Guide). Accordingly, the Commission publishes this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR) and request for comment. In addition to seeking comment on the Name Guide, the Commission, as part of its systematic review of all current FTC rules and guides, requests comment on all of its Fur Act regulations (Fur Rules or Rules).

Fair Credit Reporting Risk-Based Pricing Regulations
On January 15, 2010, the Board and the Commission published final rules to implement the risk-based pricing provisions in section 311 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The final rules generally require a creditor to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer when the creditor uses a consumer report to grant or extend credit to the consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that creditor. The Board and the Commission propose to amend their respective risk-based pricing rules to require disclosure of credit scores and information relating to credit scores in risk-based pricing notices if a credit score of the consumer is used in setting the material terms of credit. These proposed amendments reflect the new requirements in section 615(h) of the FCRA that were added by section 1100F of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Business Opportunity Rule
The Commission is adopting final amendments to its Trade Regulation Rule entitled ``Disclosure Requirements and Prohibitions Concerning Business Opportunities'' (``Business Opportunity Rule'' or ``Rule''). Among other things, the Business Opportunity Rule has been amended to broaden its scope to cover business opportunity sellers not covered by the interim Business Opportunity Rule, such as sellers of work-at-home opportunities, and to streamline and simplify the disclosures that sellers must provide to prospective purchasers. The final Rule is based upon the comments received in response to an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``ANPR''), an Initial Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``INPR''), a Revised Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (``RNPR''), a public workshop, a Staff Report, and other information discussed herein. This document also contains the text of the final Rule and the Rule's Statement of Basis and Purpose (``SBP''), including a Regulatory Analysis.

In addition, the Commission is rescinding two rules addressing mortgage advertising and mortgage assistance relief services under the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act: ``Mortgage Acts and Practices-Advertising Rule'' and ``Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rule.'' The Commission is also rescinding its rules governing ``Disclosure Requirements for Depository Institutions Lacking Federal Deposit Insurance'' under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act and its ``Procedures for State Application for Exemption from the Provisions of the [Federal Debt Collection Practices] Act.''

Premerger Notification; Reporting and Waiting Period Requirements
The Commission is proposing amendments to the premerger notification rules (``the Rules'') to provide a framework for determining when a transaction involving the transfer of rights to a patent in the pharmaceutical, including biologics, and medicine manufacturing industry (North American Industry Classification System Industry Group 3254) (``pharmaceutical industry'') is reportable under the Hart Scott Rodino Act (``the Act'' or ``HSR''). The Act and Rules require the parties to certain mergers and acquisitions to file reports with the Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission'') and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (``the Assistant Attorney General'') (collectively, ``the Agencies'') and to wait a specified period of time before consummating such transactions. The reporting and waiting period requirements are intended to enable these enforcement agencies to determine whether a proposed merger or acquisition may violate the antitrust laws if consummated and, when appropriate, to seek a preliminary injunction in federal court to prevent consummation. This proposed rulemaking uses the concept of ``all commercially significant rights'' as the basis to determine whether there is a transfer of exclusive rights to a patent in the pharmaceutical industry resulting in an asset acquisition that may be reportable under the Act.

Premerger Notification; Reporting and Waiting Period Requirements
The Commission is proposing amendments to the premerger notification rules (``the Rules'') to provide a framework for the withdrawal of a premerger notification filing under the Hart Scott Rodino Act (``the Act'' or ``HSR''). The Act and Rules require the parties to certain mergers and acquisitions to file reports with the Federal Trade Commission (``the Commission'') and the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (``the Assistant Attorney General'') (collectively, ``the Agencies'') and to wait a specified period of time before consummating such transactions. The reporting and waiting period requirements are intended to enable these enforcement agencies to determine whether a proposed merger or acquisition may violate the antitrust laws if consummated and, when appropriate, to seek a preliminary injunction in federal court to prevent consummation. This proposed rulemaking sets forth the procedure for voluntarily withdrawing an HSR filing, establishes when an HSR filing will be automatically withdrawn after an electronically submitted filing publicly announcing the termination of a transaction is made with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rules promulgated under that act, and sets forth the procedure for resubmitting a filing after a withdrawal with no additional filing fee.
