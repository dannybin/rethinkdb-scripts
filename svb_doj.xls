Commerce in Explosives-Storage of Shock Tube With Detonators (2005R-3P)
The Department of Justice is amending the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) by allowing shock tube to be stored with detonators because these materials when stored together do not pose a mass detonation hazard. Shock tube is a small diameter plastic laminate tube coated with a very thin layer of explosive material. When initiated, it transmits a low energy wave from one point to another. The outer surface of the tube remains intact during and after functioning.

Control of Ergocristine, a Chemical Precursor Used in the Illicit Manufacture of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, as a List I Chemical
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is proposing to control the chemical precursor ergocristine as a List I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Clandestine laboratories are using this chemical as a substitute for the List I chemicals ergotamine and ergonovine to illicitly manufacture the schedule I controlled substance lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). If finalized as proposed, handlers of ergocristine would be subject to the chemical regulatory provisions of the CSA and its implementing regulations, including 21 CFR parts 1309, 1310, 1313, and 1316. This rulemaking does not propose the establishment of a threshold for domestic and international transactions of ergocristine. As such, all transactions involving ergocristine, regardless of size, would be regulated. This rulemaking also proposes to specify that chemical mixtures containing ergocristine will not be exempt from regulatory requirements at any concentration. Therefore, all transactions of chemical mixtures containing any quantity of ergocristine would be regulated and subject to control under the CSA if this rule is finalized as proposed.

Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Prisoners Serving Sentences Under the United States and District of Columbia Codes
The U.S. Parole Commission is promulgating final rules to implement the District of Columbia Equitable Street Time Credit Amendment Act of 2008. This Act modifies parole laws for District of Columbia offenders by allowing the Parole Commission to terminate the supervision and legal custody of a parolee before the expiration of the parolee's sentence. The Act also modifies the requirement that a parolee lose credit for all time spent on parole when the Commission revokes the parolee's release for violating parole conditions. With these modifications, parole laws for DC offenders are more consistent with similar parole laws governing U.S. Code parole-eligible offenders. The Commission is also making a number of conforming amendments to regulations for both DC and U.S. Code offenders.

Redelegation of Authority of Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, to Branch Directors, Heads of Offices and United States Attorneys in Civil Division Cases
This final rule amends Civil Directive 14-95, published in the Appendix to Subpart Y of Part 0, which sets forth the redelegation of authority by the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Division to branch directors, heads of offices, and United States Attorneys. On May 20, 2009, the President signed the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act (FERA), which authorized the Attorney General to delegate his authority to issue civil investigative demands (CIDs). As a result, the Attorney General signed Order No. 3134-2010 (Jan. 15, 2010) delegating to the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division the Attorney General's authority to issue CIDs, and permitting that authority to be redelegated to other Department officials, including United States Attorneys. Pursuant to FERA and the Attorney General's order, the new rule would redelegate the authority of the Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division to issue CIDs in monitored and delegated cases to United States Attorneys, with a notice and reporting requirement. The new rule also eliminates certain differences between the authorities of branch directors and United States Attorneys to file, close, or compromise Civil Division cases, revise the documentation requirements in cases delegated to the latter, and make a few ``housekeeping'' revisions.

The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is revising its regulations to provide practitioners with the option of writing prescriptions for controlled substances electronically.

The regulations provide pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners with the ability to use modern technology for controlled substance prescriptions while maintaining the closed system of controls on controlled substances dispensing; additionally, the regulations will reduce paperwork for DEA registrants who dispense controlled substances and have the potential to reduce prescription forgery. The regulations will also have the potential to reduce the number of prescription errors caused by illegible handwriting and misunderstood oral prescriptions. Moreover, they will help both pharmacies and hospitals to integrate prescription records into other medical records more directly, which may increase efficiency, and potentially reduce the amount of time patients spend waiting to have their prescriptions filled.

Paroling, Recommitting, and Supervising Federal Prisoners: Prisoners Serving Sentences Under the United States and District of Columbia Codes
The U.S. Parole Commission proposes to amend a rule that implements its authority under the District of Columbia Youth Rehabilitation Act to set aside a conviction for a youth offender. The proposed rule specifies the Commission's authority to set aside a youth offender's misdemeanor conviction and describes the information the Commission examines in making such a determination, given that the misdemeanant only served a jail term for the offense without subsequent community supervision on parole or supervised release. In addition, the rule clarifies the Commission's policy for issuing a set-aside certificate for a youth offender who was formerly on supervised release and who was not reviewed for the set-aside certificate before the offender's sentence expired. The proposed rule adopts the Commission's established criteria for conducting set-aside reviews when a youth offender's parole term ends before such a review has been held.

Decision-Making Authority Regarding the Denial, Suspension, or Revocation of a Federal Firearms License, or Imposition of a Civil Fine
The Department of Justice has adopted as final, without change, an interim rule that amended the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (``ATF'') to delegate to the Director of ATF the authority to serve as the deciding official regarding the denial, suspension, or revocation of federal firearms licenses, or the imposition of a civil fine. Under the interim rule, the Director has the flexibility to delegate to another ATF official the authority to decide a revocation or denial matter, or may exercise that authority himself. Because the Director can redelegate authority to take action as the final agency decision-maker to Headquarters officials, field officials, or some combination thereof, such flexibility allows ATF to more efficiently conduct denial, suspension, and revocation hearings, and make the determination whether to impose a civil fine. This gives the agency the ability to ensure consistency in decision-making and to address any case backlogs that may occur.

Chemical Mixtures Containing Listed Forms of Phosphorus and Change in Application Process
The DEA is proposing regulations which establish those chemical mixtures containing red phosphorus, white phosphorus (also known as yellow phosphorus), or hypophosphorous acid and its salts (hereinafter ``regulated phosphorus'') that shall automatically qualify for exemption from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulatory controls. DEA is proposing that chemical mixtures containing red phosphorus in a concentration of 80 percent or less and mixtures containing hypophosphorous acid and its salts (hypophosphite salts) in a concentration of 30 percent and less, shall qualify for automatic exemption. DEA is not proposing automatic exemption for chemical mixtures containing white phosphorus. Unless otherwise exempted, all material containing white phosphorus shall become subject to CSA chemical regulatory controls regardless of concentration. DEA recognizes that concentration criteria alone cannot identify all mixtures that warrant exemption, therefore, an application process has been implemented which allows manufacturers to apply for exemption from CSA regulatory controls for those phosphorus chemical mixtures that do not qualify for automatic exemption. This rulemaking also proposes changes to the application review and notification process. While preparing this rulemaking, DEA became aware that references to section 1018 of the Act (21 U.S.C. 971) were inadvertently omitted from 21 CFR 1310.12(a) and 1310.13(i). Therefore, DEA is proposing that this rulemaking amend these sections by adding this citation. This insertion is a clarification and does not alter the current treatment of exempt chemical mixtures under the CSA.

Exempt Chemical Mixtures Containing Gamma-Butyrolactone
This rulemaking finalizes a November 12, 2008, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which DEA proposed that chemical mixtures that are 70 percent or less gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), by weight or volume, be automatically exempt from regulatory controls under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). DEA is seeking through this rulemaking to exempt only those chemical mixtures that do not represent a significant risk of diversion. This regulation makes GBL chemical mixtures, in concentrations greater than 70 percent, subject to List I chemical regulatory requirements of the CSA, except if exempted through an existing categorical exemption. DEA is taking this action because there is a serious threat to the public safety associated with the ease by which GBL is chemically converted to the schedule I controlled substance gamma-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). DEA recognizes that concentration criteria alone cannot identify all mixtures that warrant exemption. As a result, DEA regulations provide for an application process by which manufacturers may obtain exemptions from CSA regulatory controls for those GBL chemical mixtures that are not automatically exempt under the concentration criteria.

Correction of Code of Federal Regulations: Removal of Temporary Listing of Benzylfentanyl and Thenylfentanyl as Controlled Substances
This rulemaking corrects Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) by deleting regulations which list the substances benzylfentanyl and thenylfentanyl as being temporarily subject to schedule I controls under the emergency scheduling provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The temporary scheduling of benzylfentanyl and thenylfentanyl expired on November 29, 1986. DEA determined that these compounds were both essentially inactive, with no evidence of abuse potential. As such, these compounds are no longer schedule I controlled substances and all references to these compounds are being deleted from DEA regulations.

Control of Immediate Precursor Used in the Illicit Manufacture of Fentanyl as a Schedule II Controlled Substance
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is designating the precursor chemical, 4-anilino-N-phenethyl-4-piperidine (ANPP) as an immediate precursor for the schedule II controlled substance fentanyl under the definition set forth in 21 U.S.C. 802(23). Furthermore, DEA is finalizing the control of ANPP as a schedule II substance under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), pursuant to the authority in 21 U.S.C. 811(e), which states that an immediate precursor may be placed in the same schedule as the controlled substance it produces, without regard to the procedures required by 21 U.S.C. 811(a) and (b) and without regard to the findings required by 21 U.S.C. 811(a) and 812(b). ANPP is the immediate chemical intermediary in the synthesis process currently used by clandestine laboratory operators for the illicit manufacture of the schedule II controlled substance fentanyl. In 2005 and 2006, the distribution of illicitly manufactured fentanyl caused an unprecedented outbreak of hundreds of fentanyl-related overdoses in the United States. DEA believes that the control of ANPP as a schedule II controlled substance is necessary to prevent its diversion as an immediate chemical intermediary for the illicit production of fentanyl.

Radiation Exposure Compensation Act: Allowance for Costs and Expenses
By this rule the Department of Justice (``the Department'') amends its existing regulations implementing the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (``RECA'' or ``the Act'') to conform to the decision of the Tenth Circuit in the case of Hackwell v. United States, 491 F.3d 1229, 1241 (10th Cir. 2007). The Tenth Circuit held that the plain meaning of ``services rendered'' in section 9(a) of the Act revealed Congress' unambiguous intent to exclude ``costs incurred'' from the attorney fee limitation. Consequently, the court invalidated 28 CFR 79.74(b) as ``contrary to the RECA's plain language.'' Accordingly, the Department is amending its regulation at Sec. 79.74(b) to strike the language ``including costs incurred'' from the agency's limitation on payments to attorneys representing claimants under RECA.

Schedules of Controlled Substances: Placement of Propofol Into Schedule IV
This proposed rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to place the substance propofol, including its salts, isomers, and salts of isomers whenever the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible, into schedule IV of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). This proposed action is based on a recommendation from the Assistant Secretary for Health of the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) and on an evaluation of the relevant data by DEA. If finalized, this action would impose the regulatory controls and criminal sanctions of schedule IV on those who handle propofol and products containing propofol.

Listing of Approved Drug Products Containing Dronabinol in Schedule III
This proposed rule is issued by the Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to modify the listing of the Marinol[supreg] formulation in schedule III so that certain generic drug products are also included in that listing. Several products are currently the subject of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Each product is a generic formulation of Marinol[supreg] and contains dronabinol, the (-) isomer of delta-9- (trans)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which is a schedule I controlled substance. Due to variations in formulation, these generic Marinol[supreg] products do not meet the specific conditions specified in the current schedule III listing. This proposed action expands the schedule III listing to include formulations having naturally-derived dronabinol and products encapsulated in hard gelatin capsules. This would have the effect of transferring the FDA-approved versions of such generic Marinol[supreg] products from schedule I to schedule III.

Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of Five Synthetic Cannabinoids Into Schedule I
The Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this notice of intent to temporarily place five synthetic cannabinoids into the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions under 21 U.S.C. 811(h) of the CSA. The substances are 1-pentyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole (JWH-018), 1-butyl-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole (JWH-073), 1-[2-(4- morpholinyl)ethyl]-3-(1-naphthoyl)indole (JWH-200), 5-(1,1- dimethylheptyl)-2-[(1R,3S)-3-hydroxycyclohexyl]-phenol (CP-47,497), and 5-(1,1-dimethyloctyl)-2-[(1R,3S)-3-hydroxycyclohexyl]-phenol (cannabicyclohexanol; CP-47,497 C8 homologue). This intended action is based on a finding by the DEA Deputy Administrator that the placement of these synthetic cannabinoids into Schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Finalization of this action will impose criminal sanctions and regulatory controls of Schedule I substances under the CSA on the manufacture, distribution, possession, importation, and exportation of these synthetic cannabinoids.

Control of Ergocristine, a Chemical Precursor Used in the Illicit Manufacture of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide, as a List I Chemical
This rulemaking finalizes a February 24, 2010, Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in which DEA proposed to control the chemical precursor ergocristine as a List I chemical under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Clandestine laboratories are using this chemical as a substitute for the List I chemicals ergotamine and ergonovine to illicitly manufacture the schedule I controlled substance lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). This rule is being finalized as proposed. Therefore, handlers of ergocristine shall be subject to the chemical regulatory provisions of the CSA and its implementing regulations. This rulemaking does not establish a threshold for domestic and international transactions of ergocristine. As such, all transactions involving ergocristine, regardless of size, shall be regulated. This rulemaking also specifies that chemical mixtures containing ergocristine will not be exempt from regulatory requirements at any concentration. Therefore, all transactions of chemical mixtures containing any quantity of ergocristine shall be regulated and subject to control under the CSA.

Self-Certification and Employee Training of Mail-Order Distributors of Scheduled Listed Chemical Products
On October 12, 2010, the President signed the Combat Methamphetamine Enhancement Act of 2010 (MEA). It establishes new requirements for mail-order distributors of scheduled listed chemical products. Mail-order distributors must now self-certify to DEA in order to sell scheduled listed chemical products at retail. Sales at retail are those sales intended for personal use; mail-order distributors that sell scheduled listed chemical products not intended for personal use, e.g., sale to a university, are not affected by the new law. This self- certification must include a statement that the mail-order distributor understands each of the requirements that apply under part 1314 and agrees to comply with these requirements. Additionally, mail-order distributors are now required to train their employees prior to self certification. DEA is promulgating this rule to incorporate the statutory provisions and make its regulations consistent with the new requirements and other existing regulations related to self-certification.

Chemical Mixtures Containing Listed Forms of Phosphorus and Change in Application Process
This rulemaking finalizes a June 25, 2010, notice of proposed rulemaking in which DEA proposed regulations which establish those chemical mixtures containing red phosphorus or hypophosphorous acid and its salts (hereinafter ``regulated phosphorus'') that shall automatically qualify for exemption from the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) regulatory controls. Chemical mixtures containing red phosphorus in a concentration of 80 percent or less and mixtures containing hypophosphorous acid and its salts (hypophosphite salts) in a concentration of 30 percent and less, shall qualify for automatic exemption. DEA is not implementing automatic exemption for any concentration of chemical mixtures containing white phosphorus (also known as yellow phosphorus). Unless otherwise exempted, all material containing white phosphorus shall become subject to CSA chemical regulatory controls regardless of concentration. DEA recognizes that concentration criteria alone cannot identify all mixtures that warrant exemption; therefore, an application process has been implemented which allows manufacturers to apply for exemption from CSA regulatory controls for those phosphorus chemical mixtures that do not qualify for automatic exemption. This rulemaking also finalizes changes to the application review and notification process.

Establishment of a New Drug Code for Marihuana Extract
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is proposing to create a new Administration Controlled Substances Code Number (``Code Number'' or ``drug code'') under 21 CFR 1308.11 for ``Marihuana Extract.'' This Code Number will allow DEA and DEA-registered entities to track quantities of this material separately from quantities of marihuana. This in turn will aid in complying with relevant treaty provisions. Under international drug control treaties (administered by the United Nations), some differences exist between the regulatory controls pertaining to marihuana extract versus those for marihuana and tetrahydrocannabinols. DEA has established separate Code Numbers for marihuana and for tetrahydrocannabinols, but not for marihuana extract. To better track these materials and better comply with treaty provisions, DEA is proposing to create a separate Code Number for marihuana extract under 21 CFR 1308.11(d)(36): ``Marihuana Extract meaning extracts that have been derived from any plant of the genus cannabis and which contain cannabinols and cannabidiols.'' Such extracts of marihuana would continue to be treated as schedule I controlled substances.

Specifically, the final rule clarifies, supplements, and amends the proposed rule by, among other things: Expanding the geographic zone recognized as a ``9/11 crash site''; providing greater consistency with the World Trade Center Health Program by adding additional forms of proof that may be used to establish eligibility; and clarifying the types of fees and charges that would come within the caps on amounts that a claimant's representative may charge in connection with a claim made to the Fund.

Inmates who have 36 months or more until their projected release date will receive alternating program and progress reviews at least once every 180 calendar days, a practice that will allow the Bureau to more efficiently utilize staff time and resources. The process will also allow staff to devote more time and resources to the reviews of inmates who are closer to their release dates, enabling the Bureau to better fulfill its mission to prepare inmates for eventual release into communities within the United States.

Forwarding of Asylum Applications to the Department of State
The Department of Justice is planning to amend its regulations to alter the process by which the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) forwards asylum applications for consideration by the Department of State (DOS). Currently, EOIR forwards to DOS all asylum applications that are submitted initially in removal proceedings before an immigration judge. The proposed rule would amend the regulations to provide for sending asylum applications to DOS on a discretionary basis. For example, EOIR could forward an application in order to ascertain whether DOS has information relevant to the applicant's eligibility for asylum. This change would increase the efficiency of DOS's review of asylum applications and is consistent with similar changes already made by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

Classification of Two Steroids, Prostanozol and Methasterone, as Schedule III Anabolic Steroids Under the Controlled Substances Act
This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) proposes to classify the following two steroids as ``anabolic steroids'' under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA): prostanozol (17[beta]-hydroxy- 5[alpha]-androstano[3,2-c]pyrazole) and methasterone (2[alpha],17[alpha]-dimethyl-5[alpha]-androstan-17[beta]-ol-3-one). The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) believes that this action is necessary to prevent the abuse and trafficking of these steroids. If the regulations are amended, these steroids will be listed as Schedule III controlled substances subject to the regulatory control provisions of the CSA.

Importation of Arms, Ammunition and Implements of War and Machine Guns, Destructive Devices, and Certain Other Firearms; Extending the Term of Import Permits (2010R-26P)
The Department of Justice is proposing to amend the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to extend the term of import permits for firearms, ammunition, and defense articles from 1 year to 2 years. The additional time will allow importers sufficient time to complete the importation of the authorized commodity. In addition, it will eliminate the need for the importer to submit a new import application, ATF Form 6, where the importation was not completed within the 1-year period. Extending the term of import permits will result in a substantial cost and time savings for both the industry and ATF. This proposed change would be consistent with Executive Order 13563 of January 18, 2011, which directs agencies to review existing significant rules to make regulatory programs more effective or less burdensome in achieving regulatory objectives.

Firearms Disabilities for Certain Nonimmigrant Aliens (2001R-332P)
In 2002, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) published an interim final rule implementing the provision of the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, relating to firearms disabilities for certain nonimmigrant aliens. That regulation implemented the law by prohibiting, with certain exceptions, the sale or disposition of firearms or ammunition to, and the possession, shipment, transportation, or receipt of firearms or ammunition by, nonimmigrant aliens. The Department of Justice has now determined that the relevant statutory prohibitions on transfer and possession of firearms and ammunition apply only to nonimmigrant aliens who were admitted to the United States under a nonimmigrant visa, and that the prohibitions do not apply to nonimmigrant aliens who lawfully entered the United States without a visa. The Department is therefore issuing this rule to make conforming changes to the regulations, so that the regulations are consistent with the Department's current legal interpretation. This final rule addresses only the nonimmigrant alien visa issue. The remaining issues raised by the 2002 interim final rule, and the public comments submitted with respect to those issues, will be addressed in a separate forthcoming rule.

The Department has determined that the Gun Control Act does not permit ATF to impose a regulatory requirement that aliens lawfully present in the United States are subject to a 90-day State residency requirement when such a requirement is not applicable to U.S. citizens. In addition, upon the effective date of this interim final rule the provisions of ATF Ruling 2004-1 will become obsolete.

Many years of experience have demonstrated that forfeiting the assets of criminals is an essential tool in combating criminal activity and provides law enforcement with the capacity to dismantle criminal organizations that would continue to function after the conviction and incarceration of individual offenders. Moreover, administrative forfeiture permits the expedient and effective use of this crucial law enforcement tool.

This final rule (``rule'') sets forth procedures and criteria United States Trustees shall use when determining whether applicants seeking to become and remain approved nonprofit budget and credit counseling agencies (``credit counseling agencies'' or ``agencies'') satisfy all prerequisites of the United States Code, as implemented under this rule. Under the current law, an individual may not be a debtor under title 11 of the United States Code, unless during the 180- day period preceding the date of filing a bankruptcy petition, the individual receives adequate counseling from a credit counseling agency that is approved by the United States Trustee. The current law enumerates mandatory prerequisites and minimum standards applicants seeking to become approved credit counseling agencies must meet. Under this rule, United States Trustees will approve applicants for inclusion on publicly available agency lists in one or more federal judicial districts if an applicant establishes it meets all the requirements of the United States Code, as implemented under this rule. After obtaining such approval, a credit counseling agency shall be authorized to provide credit counseling in a federal judicial district during the time the agency remains approved. EOUST intends to add to its regulations governing credit counseling agencies, two new provisions not previously included in the proposed rule on this subject. A new section 58.17(c)(11) will require agencies to notify the United States Trustee of certain actions pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 111(g)(2) or other consumer protection statutes, such as an entry of judgment or mediation award, or the agency's entry into a settlement order, consent decree, or assurance of voluntary compliance. The second provision will amend section 58.20(j) to require an agency to assist an individual with limited English proficiency by expeditiously directing the individual to an agency that can provide counseling in the language of the individual's choice. Because these provisions were not discussed in the proposed rule published on February 1, 2008, EOUST will publish another Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requesting public comment with respect to these two provisions.

Application Procedures and Criteria for Approval of Providers of a Personal Financial Management Instructional Course by United States Trustees
This final rule (``rule'') sets forth procedures and criteria United States Trustees shall use when determining whether applicants seeking to become and remain approved providers of a personal financial management instructional course (``providers'') satisfy all prerequisites of the United States Code, as implemented under this rule. Under the current law, individual debtors must participate in an instructional course concerning personal financial management (``instructional course'' or ``debtor education'') before receiving a discharge of debts. The current law enumerates mandatory prerequisites and minimum standards applicants seeking to become approved providers must meet. Under this rule, United States Trustees will approve applicants for inclusion on publicly available provider lists in one or more federal judicial districts if an applicant establishes it meets all the requirements of the United States Code, as implemented under this rule. After obtaining such approval, a provider shall be authorized to provide an instructional course in a federal judicial district during the time the provider remains approved. EOUST intends to add to its regulations governing debtor education providers, two new provisions not previously included in the proposed rule. The first provision will amend section 58.30(c)(5) to require providers to notify the United States Trustee of certain actions pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 111(g)(2) or other consumer protection statutes, such as an entry of judgment or mediation award, or the provider's entry into a settlement order, consent decree, or assurance of voluntary compliance. The second provision will amend section 58.33(i) to require a provider to assist an individual with limited English proficiency by expeditiously directing the individual to a provider that can provide instruction in the language of the individual's choice. Because these provisions were not discussed in the proposed rule published on November 14, 2008, EOUST will publish another Notice of Proposed Rulemaking requesting public comment with respect to these two provisions.

Periodic Review of Existing Regulations; Retrospective Review Under E.O. 13563
On January 18, 2011, the President issued Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' which sets forth principles and requirements designed to promote public participation, improve integration and innovation, increase flexibility, ensure scientific integrity, and increase retrospective analysis of existing rules. On August 22, 2011, pursuant to that Executive Order, the Department of Justice published its Final Plan for Retrospective Review of Existing Regulations. Then, on May 10, 2012, the President issued Executive Order 13610, ``Identifying and Reducing Regulatory Burdens,'' which requires agencies to ``invite, on a regular basis * * * public suggestions about regulations in need of retrospective review and about appropriate modifications to such regulations. In accordance with Executive Orders 13563 and 13610, and the Department's Final Plan, the Department invites interested members of the public to submit suggestions as to which Department of Justice Regulations should be modified, streamlined, expanded or repealed.

Forwarding of Asylum Applications to the Department of State
This final rule adopts without substantive change the proposed rule with request for comments published in the Federal Register on October 31, 2011, and includes several non-substantive, technical corrections. The Department of Justice (Department) is amending its regulations to alter the process by which the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR) forwards asylum applications for consideration by the Department of State (DOS), Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. Currently, EOIR forwards to DOS all asylum applications that are submitted initially in removal proceedings before an immigration judge. The final rule amends the regulations to provide for sending asylum applications to DOS on a discretionary basis. For example, EOIR may forward an application in order to ascertain whether DOS has information relevant to the applicant's eligibility for asylum. This change increases the efficiency of DOS' review of asylum applications and is consistent with similar changes already made by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

The Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this notice of intent to temporarily schedule three synthetic cannabinoids into the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of 21 U.S.C. 811(h). The substances are 1-pentyl-1H-indol-3-yl)(2,2,3,3- tetramethylcyclopropyl)methanone (UR-144), 1-(5-fluoro-pentyl)-1H- indol-3-yl](2,2,3,3-tetramethylcyclopropyl)methanone (5-fluoro-UR-144; XLR11) and N-(1-adamantyl)-1-pentyl-1H-indazole-3-carboxamide (APINACA, AKB48). This action is based on a finding by the Deputy Administrator that the placement of these synthetic cannabinoids into Schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. Any final order will be published in the Federal Register and may not be issued prior to May 13, 2013. Any final order will impose the administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions and regulatory controls of Schedule I substances under the CSA on the manufacture, distribution, possession, importation, and exportation of these synthetic cannabinoids.

The Department of Justice proposes amending Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) regulations that concern the making or transferring of a firearm under the National Firearms Act (NFA). The proposed changes include: Defining the term ``responsible person,'' as used in reference to a trust, partnership, association, company, or corporation; requiring ``responsible persons'' of such legal entities to submit, inter alia, photographs and fingerprints, as well as a law enforcement certificate, when the legal entity files an application to make an NFA firearm or is listed as the transferee on an application to transfer an NFA firearm; modifying the information required in a law enforcement certificate, so that the certificate no longer requires a statement from the certifying official that he or she has no information indicating that the maker or transferee of the NFA firearm will use the firearm for other than lawful purposes; and adding a new section to ATF's regulations to address the possession and transfer of firearms registered to a decedent. The new section would clarify that the executor, administrator, personal representative, or other person authorized under state law to dispose of property in an estate may possess a firearm registered to a decedent during the term of probate without such possession being treated as a ``transfer'' under the NFA. It also would specify that the transfer of the firearm to any beneficiary of the estate may be made on a tax-exempt basis.

Exemption of Records Systems Under the Privacy Act
The Department of Justice (the Department or DOJ) proposes to amend its Privacy Act regulations for two systems of records entitled the ``Drug Enforcement Task Force Evaluation and Reporting System, JUSTICE/DAG-003,'' last published, March 10, 1992 in the Federal Register, and the ``Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Fusion Center and International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center System, JUSTICE/CRM-028,'' last published, June 3, 2009 in the Federal Register. These Privacy Act regulations are being amended to reflect a recent reorganization of the Department establishing the Executive Office for OCDETF as a separate DOJ component, and transferring responsibility for these systems from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (ODAG) and the Criminal Division to this component. In light of this departmental reorganization, JUSTICE/DAG- 003 is being renumbered to JUSTICE/OCDETF-001 and will be renamed as the ``Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces Management Information System (OCDETF MIS).'' JUSTICE/CRM-028 is being renumbered to JUSTICE/OCDETF-002 but will retain its system name. When under the responsibility of ODAG and the Criminal Division, these systems were exempted from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 by exemptions placed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections containing exemptions for ODAG's and the Criminal Division's Privacy Act systems. These proposed amendments will remove references to these systems from the CFR sections for ODAG and Criminal Division exemptions and add a new section for OCDETF exemptions.

Exemption of Records Systems Under the Privacy Act
The Department of Justice (the Department or DOJ) amends its Privacy Act regulations for two Privacy Act systems of records previously entitled the ``Drug Enforcement Task Force Evaluation and Reporting System,'' JUSTICE/DAG-003, and the ``Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force Fusion Center and International Organized Crime Intelligence and Operations Center System,'' JUSTICE/CRM-028. These amendments reflect a recent reorganization of the Department establishing the Executive Office for OCDETF as a separate DOJ component, and transferring responsibility for these systems from the Office of the Deputy Attorney General (ODAG) and the Criminal Division to this component. In light of this departmental reorganization, JUSTICE/DAG-003 has been renumbered to JUSTICE/OCDETF- 001 and renamed as the ``Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Forces Management Information System (OCDETF MIS),'' and JUSTICE/CRM-028 has been renumbered to JUSTICE/OCDETF-002 while retaining the same name. When under the responsibility of ODAG and the Criminal Division, these systems were exempted from certain provisions of the Privacy Act of 1974 by exemptions placed in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) sections containing exemptions for ODAG's and the Criminal Division's Privacy Act systems. These amendments remove references to these systems from the CFR sections for ODAG and Criminal Division exemptions and add a new section for OCDETF exemptions, which continues comparable exemptions for these systems in order to avoid interference with the law enforcement functions and responsibilities of the Executive office for OCDETF.

Amended Definition of “Adjudicated as a Mental Defective” and “Committed to a Mental Institution” (2010R-21P)
The Department of Justice proposes amending Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) regulations to clarify definitions of two categories of persons who are prohibited from receiving, possessing, shipping, or transporting firearms under the Gun Control Act of 1968. The proposed rule would clarify that the statutory term ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' includes persons who are found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, lack of mental responsibility, or insanity, and that the term includes persons found guilty but mentally ill. The Department recognizes that the term ``mental defective'' is outdated, but it is included in the statute and cannot be amended by regulation. The proposed amendments would further clarify that federal, state, local, and military courts are recognized lawful authorities that can find persons incompetent to stand trial or find them not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, lack of mental responsibility, or insanity. The proposed rule seeks public comments regarding whether the statutory term ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' includes an adjudication that occurred when the person was under the age of 18. This proposed rulemaking would also amend ATF regulations to clarify that the statutory term ``committed to a mental institution'' applies to involuntary inpatient or outpatient treatment. The proposed rule seeks public comments regarding whether the statutory term ``committed to a mental institution'' includes an involuntary commitment that occurred when the person was under the age of 18.

Office of the Attorney General; Amendment of Americans with Disabilities Act Title II and Title III Regulations to Implement ADA Amendments Act of 2008
The Department of Justice (Department) is issuing this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) to amend its Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) regulations in order to incorporate the statutory changes to the ADA set forth in the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 (ADA Amendments Act or the Act), which took effect on January 1, 2009. Congress enacted the ADA Amendments Act in order to revise the ADA definition of ``disability'' and to ensure that the definition is broadly construed and applied without extensive analysis. In this NPRM, the Department is proposing to add new sections to its title II and title III ADA regulations at 28 CFR parts 35 and 36, respectively, to provide detailed definitions of ``disability'' and to make consistent changes in other sections of the regulations. The ADA Amendments Act authorizes the Attorney General to issue regulations consistent with the Act that implement the definitions of ``disability'' in sections 3 and 4 of the Act, including the rules of construction set forth in section 3. The Department invites written comments from members of the public on this proposed rule.

Importation of Arms, Ammunition and Implements of War and Machine Guns, Destructive Devices, and Certain Other Firearms; Extending the Term of Import Permits (2010R-26P)
This rule amends the regulations of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives (ATF) to extend the standard term of import permits for firearms, ammunition, and defense articles from 1 year to 2 years. The additional time will allow importers sufficient time to complete the importation of the authorized commodity. In addition, it will eliminate the need for the importer to submit a new import application, ATF Form 6, where the importation was not completed within the 1-year period. Extending the term of import permits will result in a substantial cost and time savings for both the industry and ATF, and will not cause any discernible adverse effects.

The Office of Justice Programs (OJP) of the U.S. Department of Justice proposes this rule to amend the regulation that implements the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) Act and associated statutes. Generally speaking, these laws provide financial support to certain public safety officers, or their survivors and families, when such officers die, or become permanently and totally disabled, as a result of line-of-duty injuries, or when they die of heart attacks or strokes sustained within statutorily-specified timeframes of engaging or participating in certain line-of-duty activity. The proposed rule would amend the implementing regulation in order to change the definition of ``Spouse.''

Schedules of Controlled Substances: Temporary Placement of 10 Synthetic Cathinones Into Schedule I
The Deputy Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is issuing this final order to temporarily schedule 10 synthetic cathinones into schedule I pursuant to the temporary scheduling provisions of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). The 10 substances are: 4-methyl-N-ethylcathinone (``4-MEC''); 4-methyl- alpha-pyrrolidinopropiophenone (``4-MePPP''); alpha- pyrrolidinopentiophenone (``[alpha]-PVP''); 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2- (methylamino)butan-1-one (``butylone''); 2-(methylamino)-1- phenylpentan-1-one (``pentedrone''); 1-(1,3-benzodioxol-5-yl)-2- (methylamino)pentan-1-one (``pentylone''); 4-fluoro-N-methylcathinone (``4-FMC''); 3-fluoro-N-methylcathinone (``3-FMC''); 1-(naphthalen-2- yl)-2-(pyrrolidin-1-yl)pentan-1-one (``naphyrone''); and alpha- pyrrolidinobutiophenone (``[alpha]-PBP''). This action is based on a finding by the Deputy Administrator that the placement of these synthetic cathinones and their optical, positional, and geometric isomers, salts and salts of isomers into schedule I of the CSA is necessary to avoid an imminent hazard to the public safety. As a result of this order, the regulatory controls and administrative, civil, and criminal sanctions applicable to schedule I controlled substances will be imposed on persons who handle (manufacture, distribute, import, export, engage in research, conduct instructional activities, and possess), or propose to handle these synthetic cathinones.
