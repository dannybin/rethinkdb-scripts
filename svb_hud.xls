HOPE for Homeowners Program; Statutory Transfer of Program Authority to HUD and Conforming Amendments To Adopt Recently Enacted Statutory Changes
This rule implements the changes made to the HOPE for Homeowners (H4H) program by the recently enacted Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009. Prior to enactment of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009, rulemaking authority was under the Board of Directors of the HOPE for Homeowners Program (Board), and the regulations for the program are codified in a chapter of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) reserved for the Board. The H4H program is a temporary program that offers homeowners and existing mortgage loan holders (or servicers acting on their behalf) insurance on the refinancing of loans for distressed mortgagors to support long-term sustainable homeownership, including, among other things, allowing homeowners to avoid foreclosure. The statute also transfers program responsibility for the H4H program to the Secretary of HUD. Previously, the program was overseen by a Board consisting of HUD, the Department of the Treasury, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Federal Reserve Board. The Board will continue in an advisory capacity to the Secretary of HUD on the implementation of the program. HUD also takes the opportunity afforded by this rule to address the two public comments received on the January 7, 2009, interim rule issued by the Board. Comments received in response to this rule will be taken into consideration in the development of a final rule, to follow this interim rule.

Reporting of Fraudulent Financial Instruments
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is issuing a final regulation that requires the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and each Federal Home Loan Bank (collectively, regulated entities) to submit a timely report to FHFA upon discovery that it has purchased or sold a fraudulent loan or financial instrument, or suspects a possible fraud relating to the purchase or sale of any loan or financial instrument. The final regulation also requires the regulated entities to establish and maintain internal controls, policies, procedures, and operational training programs to ensure that any fraudulent loan or financial instrument or possible fraudulent loan or financial instrument is discovered and reported.

Refinement of Income and Rent Determination Requirements in Public and Assisted Housing Programs: Implementation of the Enterprise Income Verification System; Withdrawal of Rescinded Regulatory Amendments
On December 29, 2009, HUD published a final rule to require the use of the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system by public housing agencies and multifamily housing owners and management agents when verifying the employment and income of program participants. The purpose of the December 2009, final rule was to clarify certain provisions of HUD's January 27, 2009, final rule on the same subject matter, and to return other regulatory provisions to their pre-January 2009, final rule content. Although the preamble to the December 29, 2009, final rule clearly stated that the December 29, 2009, final rule was rescinding specified regulatory changes made by the January 27, 2009, final rule, the regulatory text of the December 29, 2009, final rule inadvertently omitted the corresponding regulatory instruction to that effect. This final rule corrects this omission by formally withdrawing the rescinded regulatory amendments consistent with the stated purpose of the December 29, 2009, final rule.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program-Refinancing Hospital Loans
This rule proposes to revise the regulations governing FHA's Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program (Section 242 program) for the purpose of codifying, in regulation, FHA's implementation of its authority that allows hospitals to refinance existing loans, without requiring such refinancing to take place only in conjunction with the expenditure of funds for construction or renovation, which is the existing program requirement. The current downturn in the economy, which has reduced the availability of private financing, has not only adversely affected the housing industry, but has had a serious impact on hospitals across the Nation. At a time when the demand for health care services is on the rise, the lack of access to capital has made it difficult for hospitals to obtain financing for facility, equipment, and technology needs, as well as to meet obligations on existing debt. By expanding FHA's Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program to allow for refinancing of existing debt without conditioning such refinancing on new construction or renovation, HUD believes it can contribute to alleviating financial stress on hospitals and maintaining the availability of hospitals in many communities. This refinancing authority is specifically for the refinancing of non-FHA-insured loans of hospitals. Hospitals currently insured under FHA's Section 242 program may refinance under the National Housing Act. In order to allow eligible hospitals seeking to refinance debt the opportunity to immediately apply for a refinanced loan under the Section 242 program, FHA proceeded to implement this authority by notice issued on July 1, 2009, and, as subsequently revised by a January 2010 notice. This proposed rule provides the regulatory format for such implementation and seeks comment on the implementation. Comments received in response to this rule will be taken into consideration in the development of a final rule that will codify in regulation FHA's refinancing authority for hospitals.

Section 108 Community Development Loan Guarantee Program: Participation of States as Borrowers Pursuant to Section 222 of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009
This final rule follows publication of a July 22, 2009, interim rule that implemented section 222 in Division I of the Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009. Section 222 authorizes HUD, to the extent of its Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 loan guarantee authority, to provide community development loan guarantees, under section 108 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, to States borrowing on behalf of local governments in nonentitlement areas (governments that do not receive annual Community Development Block Grants (CDBGs) from HUD). Section 108 authorizes HUD to guarantee notes issued by such nonentitlement local governments or their designated public agencies supported by the respective State's pledge of its CDBG funds. Prior to the enactment of section 222, HUD lacked authority to guarantee notes issued by States on behalf of local governments in nonentitlement areas. HUD received a single public comment on the July 22, 2009, interim rule, which expressed support for the interim regulatory amendments. HUD is adopting the interim rule without change.

Regulatory Reporting Requirements for the Indian Community Development Block Grant Program
This final rule revises the reporting requirements for the Indian Community Development Block Grants (ICDBG) program. First, the rule provides for submission of a single annual report on the hiring of minority business enterprises, due each October. Currently, ICDBG grantees are required to report on these activities on a semiannual basis, with reports being due to HUD on April 10 and October 10 of each year. Second, this rule requires ICDBG grantees to use the Logic Model form developed as part of HUD's Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) process. The required use of the Logic Model will conform the ICDBG reporting requirements to those of other HUD competitive funding programs, and enhance the evaluation of grantee performance by ensuring uniformity in the information provided by ICDBG grantees on performance goals. This final rule follows publication of an October 23, 2009, proposed rule on which HUD received two public comments, both of which were supportive of the rule.

Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing: Defining “Homeless”
This rule commences HUD's regulatory implementation of the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act), enacted into law on May 20, 2009. The HEARTH Act consolidates three of the separate homeless assistance programs administered by HUD under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act into a single grant program and creates the Emergency Solutions Grant Program and the Rural Housing Stability Program. The HEARTH Act also codifies in statutory law the Continuum of Care planning process, long a part of HUD's application process to assist homeless persons by providing greater coordination in responding to their needs. The HEARTH Act defines the terms ``homeless,'' ``homeless individual,'' ``homeless person,'' and ``homeless individual with a disability,'' but these definitions contain terms that require further elaboration. Since the scope of these terms is essential to the development of an appropriate regulatory structure for the homeless assistance programs as consolidated and amended by the HEARTH Act, HUD is initiating the rulemaking process with this proposed rule, which solely addresses the definition of these terms.

Federal Housing Administration: Continuation of FHA Reform; Strengthening Risk Management Through Responsible FHA-Approved Lenders
This final rule adopts changes pertaining to the approval of mortgage lenders by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) that are designed to strengthen FHA by improving its management of risk. This final rule increases the net worth requirement for FHA-approved mortgagees. The increase, the first since 1993, is adopted to ensure that FHA-approved mortgagees are sufficiently capitalized for the financial transactions occurring, and concomitant risks present, in today's economy. This final rule also provides for elimination of the FHA approval process for loan correspondents. Loan correspondents will no longer be approved participants in FHA programs. Loan correspondents, however, will continue to have the opportunity to participate in FHA programs as third-party originators (TPOs) through sponsorship by FHA-approved mortgagees, as is currently the case, or through application to be approved as an FHA-approved mortgagee. In eliminating FHA's approval of loan correspondents, FHA-approved mortgagees assume full responsibility to ensure that a sponsored loan correspondent adheres to FHA's loan origination and processing requirements. Finally, this final rule updates FHA's regulations to incorporate criteria specified in the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009 (HFSH Act) designed to ensure that only entities of integrity are involved in the origination of FHA-insured loans. HUD also takes the opportunity afforded by this final rule to solicit comment on whether to adopt additional net worth requirements for FHA-approved mortgagees that originate multifamily mortgages of $25 million or more.

Through this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPR), HUD commences the process of initiating rulemaking directed to strengthening and clarifying the prohibition against the ``required use'' of affiliated settlement service providers in residential mortgage transactions under section 8 of RESPA. HUD has received complaints that some homebuyers are committing to use a builder's affiliated mortgage lender in exchange for construction discounts or discounted upgrades, without sufficient time to research their contracts or to comparison shop. The purpose of this ANPR is to solicit information that can be used to inform any future revision or clarification of the regulatory definition of the ``required use'' of affiliated settlement service providers in residential mortgage transactions. With this ANPR, HUD seeks comment from an array of sources with experience or knowledge of affiliated business arrangements in residential mortgage transactions.

Changes to the existing roof truss testing procedures were part of the first group of MHCC proposals submitted to HUD in 2003 to revise various aspects of the standards. However, in response to public comments on the proposed rule, including those submitted by MHCC, HUD returned the proposal on roof truss testing to MHCC for further consideration. After further consideration, MHCC has submitted an amended version of its 2003 proposal on roof truss testing to HUD. HUD is in agreement with the majority of MHCC's current recommendations on roof truss testing. This proposed rule contains the recommendations on which HUD and MHCC agree.

A referral is not a compensable service for which a broker or agent may receive compensation.

HUD has reviewed those proposals and has made several editorial revisions to the proposals, and those revisions have been reviewed and accepted by the MHCC.

Conforming Changes to Applicant Submission Requirements; Implementing Federal Financial Report and Central Contractor Registration Requirements
This interim rule revises HUD regulations to reference the new governmentwide Federal Financial Report (FFR), approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The purpose of the FFR is to consolidate requirements from the OMB issued Standard Forms SF-269, SF- 269A SF-272, and the SF-272A, into a single governmentwide form. The consolidation provides recipients of HUD grants and cooperative agreements a standard format for reporting the financial status of their grants and cooperative agreements and will assist in efforts to move to electronic grants management by reducing the variation and number of forms required for reporting. In including the new FFR in its regulations, HUD revises its regulations to remove references to SF-270 and SF-271, since they are no longer in use. This interim rule also codifies the requirement that applicants for HUD assistance possess an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Registration with CCR assists HUD in collecting, validating, and storing information in support of its grant programs and assists in ensuring the accuracy of data placed on the USASpending.gov website.

Rules of Practice and Procedure
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) solicits written comment on a proposed rule to implement the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) amendments to the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 (Safety and Soundness Act) and the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (Bank Act) pertaining to the civil enforcement powers of FHFA, and the Rules of Practice and Procedure for enforcement proceedings. The Safety and Soundness Act, as amended by sections 1151-1158 of HERA, authorizes FHFA to initiate enforcement proceedings against the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (together, the Enterprises) and the Federal Home Loan Banks (the Banks) (collectively, the regulated entities), and entity-affiliated parties as defined in the Safety and Soundness Act. When final, the rule will replace the existing Rules of Practice and Procedure promulgated by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) and the Federal Housing Finance Board (Finance Board) formerly charged with overseeing the regulated entities. The proposed rule may provide FHFA personnel, the regulated entities, entity-affiliated parties, and other interested parties with the clear guidance necessary to prepare for and participate in the administrative enforcement action process to increase the efficiency and transparency of FHFA's administrative enforcement hearings.

Prohibition of the Escrowing of Tax Credit Equity
This rule conforms HUD's Federal Housing Administration multifamily mortgage insurance regulations to a provision in Title VIII of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 that prohibits a requirement that tax credit sales proceeds be placed into escrow, at the time of initial endorsement, for assurance of project completion and to pay the initial service charge, carrying charges, and legal and organizational expenses incident to the construction of the project. This rule does not prohibit HUD from requiring escrows of funds for other purposes, such as for working capital. The rule also makes other changes to reduce burdens on the use of tax credits.

This document is limited to implementation of HUD's proposal to introduce a minimum credit score threshold and reduce the maximum LTV. At the end of the public comment period on August 16, 2010, HUD received 902 comments. The overwhelming majority of these comments focused on HUD's proposal to cap seller concessions. HUD is continuing to review and consider the issues raised by commenters on capping seller concessions as well as those pertaining to HUD's proposal to tighten manual underwriting guidelines. HUD's final decision on these two proposals will be addressed separately.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Single Family Lender Insurance Process: Eligibility, Indemnification, and Termination
Through this proposed rule, HUD continues its efforts to improve and expand the risk management activities of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The proposed regulatory changes will update and enhance the Lender Insurance process through which the majority of FHA-insured mortgages are endorsed for insurance. Most significantly, the proposed rule would provide additional guidance on HUD's regulations implementing the statutory requirements regarding mortgagee indemnification to HUD of insurance claims in the case of fraud, misrepresentation, or noncompliance with applicable loan origination requirements. The proposed rule also provides that mortgagees must continually maintain the acceptable claim and default rate required for eligibility to initially be delegated Lender Insurance authority, in order to retain such authority. In addition, this proposed rule also provides that HUD will review Lender Insurance mortgagee performance on a continual basis. HUD also proposes to revise the methodology for determining acceptable claim and default rates, to more accurately reflect mortgagee performance, and to streamline the approval process for Lender Insurance mortgagees that have undergone a corporate restructuring. The Department has also taken the opportunity afforded by this proposed rule to make two technical corrections to the regulations and to solicit public comment on whether FHA mortgagees should be required to submit mortgage loan case binders to HUD electronically.

Use of Public Housing Capital Funds for Financing Activities
This final rule implements a program to allow public housing agencies (PHAs) to use proceeds of their Capital Fund program for financing activities, including payment of debt service and housing development and modernization activities. A PHA may grant a security interest in future Capital Fund grants, subject to the appropriation of those funds by Congress. This final rule follows a July 18, 2007, proposed rule that addressed the use of public housing Capital Funds and Operating Funds for financing activities, and takes into consideration the public comments received on that rule. This final rule addresses only the use of public housing Capital Funds for financing activities. Given the public comment received on the proposed rule, HUD determined that further consideration must be given to HUD's proposal for use of operating funds for financing activities. The final rule makes changes to the proposed rule in response to public comments, including a streamlined approval process for standard and high-performing PHAs that have borrowings against their Capital Funds within certain limits, or that propose to use their Capital Fund financing proceeds in a mixed-finance development. The final rule, also in response to comment, provides greater specificity than the proposed rule with respect to submission requirements for requests for Capital Fund financing transactions.

HUD Multifamily Rental Projects: Regulatory Revisions
This proposed rule would amend certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA) regulations to update these regulations to reflect current HUD policy in the area of multifamily rental projects. On January 21, 2010, HUD issued for public comment a comprehensive set of closing documents for use in FHA multifamily rental projects. As noted in the January 21, 2010, notice, the issuance of revised multifamily rental project closing documents for public comments is HUD's effort to restart the update of these documents that first commenced in 2004, but was not completed. In 2004, HUD also issued a companion proposed rule that identified outdated language and policies that not only needed to be changed in closing documents but also in HUD's regulations. Consistent with the restart of the updating of multifamily rental project closing documents, HUD is once again issuing a corresponding proposed rule to remove outdated regulatory language and policies. Neither the closing documents issued for comment on January 21, 2010, nor this proposed rule include changes to regulations affecting health care forms for nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, board and care homes, and assisted living facilities. HUD will propose changes to those documents separately. Through update of the multifamily rental project closing documents and the update of certain regulations as provided in this proposed rule, HUD strives to have its documents and regulations reflect current terminology, lending laws, and practices with respect to multifamily projects.

As the Nation's housing agency, HUD administers programs designed to meet the goal of ensuring decent housing and suitable living environment for all. In pursuit of this goal, it is HUD's responsibility to ensure that all who are otherwise eligible to participate in HUD's programs have equal access to these programs and have the opportunity to compete fairly for HUD funds without being subject to arbitrary exclusion. There is evidence, however, that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals and families are being arbitrarily excluded from some housing opportunities in the private sector. Through this proposed rule, HUD strives to ensure that its core programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.

Alternatives to Use of Credit Ratings in Regulations Governing the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Federal Home Loan Banks

Section 939A of the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) provides Federal agencies with one-year to review regulations that require the use of an assessment of the credit- worthiness of a security or money market instrument and any references to, or requirements in, such regulations regarding credit ratings, and to remove such references or requirements. In this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR), the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) describes the relevant regulations affected by this provision of the Dodd-Frank Act and requests comments on potential alternatives to the use of credit ratings in these regulations.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Refinancing an Existing Cooperative Under Section 207 Pursuant to Section 223(f) of the National Housing Act
HUD proposes to revise its regulations governing the eligibility for FHA insurance of mortgages used for the purchase or refinancing of existing multifamily housing projects. Although the statutory language authorizing such insurance does not distinguish between rental or cooperative multifamily projects, HUD's current regulations limit FHA insurance to existing rental projects. Given the current crisis in the capital markets and the significant downturn in the multifamily market, the Department has determined that this is an appropriate time to reconsider this regulatory imposed limitation with respect to the mortgage insurance for the refinancing of cooperative projects. As mortgage lenders strive to increase capital reserves and tighten underwriting standards, the availability of financing for multifamily housing has been reduced. FHA mortgage insurance could significantly improve the availability of funds and permit more favorable interest rates than would otherwise be likely. Accordingly, this proposed rule would revise HUD's regulations to enable existing multifamily cooperative project owners to obtain FHA insurance for the refinancing of existing indebtedness.

This proposed rule combines and streamlines the former legacy public housing modernization programs, including the Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP), the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), and the Public Housing Development Program (which encompasses mixed-finance development), into the Capital Fund Program (CFP). This rule proposes a change to the Public Housing Agency Annual Plan regulation to incorporate the definition of qualified public housing agencies (PHAs), which was mandated by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act (HERA) of 2008, and to decouple or separate the CFP informational requirements from the PHA Annual Plan requirements. Also proposed is the ability for PHAs to request a total development cost (TDC) exception for integrated utility management, capital planning, and other capital and management activities that maximize energy conservation and efficiency, including green construction and retrofits, which include windows; heating system replacements; wall insulation; site-based generation; advanced energy savings technologies, including renewable energy generation; and other such retrofits. The structure of the proposed Public Housing Capital Fund Program regulation is described in section IV of the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION. Several regulations would be eliminated with the implementation of this rule, along with the issuance of new and/or revised CFP forms, including the CFP Annual Statement/Performance and Evaluation Report (form HUD-50075.1), CFP 5-Year Action Plan (form HUD-50075.2), and the CFP Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) Amendment, as well as a new guidebook.

HUD is proposing to revise its regulations that implement statutory requirements concerning how manufacturers and others address reports of problems with manufactured homes. These ``Subpart I'' regulations establish a system of protections with respect to imminent safety hazards and violations of the Federal construction and safety standards, assuring a minimum of formality and delay, while protecting the rights of all parties. The regulations implement requirements established by Congress in the National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974. Manufacturers, retailers, and distributors, State Administrative Agencies, primary inspection agencies, and the Secretary would follow the procedures set out in Subpart I to assure that notification and correction are provided with respect to manufactured homes, when required. These remedial actions are not required, however, for failures that occur in any manufactured home or component as the result of normal wear and aging, unforeseeable consumer abuse, or unreasonable neglect of maintenance.

Second, this interim rule establishes new regulations that specify the actions or inactions by which a PHA can be determined to be in substantial default, the procedures for a PHA to respond to such a determination or finding, and the sanctions available to HUD to address and remedy substantial default by a PHA.

Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program
This interim rule reinstates, with certain modifications, regulations that HUD formerly published to serve as the framework by which emergency relief may be provided to homeowners experiencing temporary involuntary loss of employment or underemployment resulting in a substantial reduction in income due to adverse economic conditions, and who consequently are financially unable to make full mortgage payments. These regulations were promulgated following enactment of the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Act of 1975. This 1975 statute provided standby authority to the Secretary to insure or make loans to homeowners to defray mortgage expenses, so as to prevent widespread mortgage foreclosures and distress sales of homes resulting from a homeowner's substantial reduction income. Although the 1975 regulations were quickly put in place, they were not utilized, and HUD eventually removed the regulations from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) in 1995. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, recently enacted into law, reauthorized the 1975 statute, with certain amendments, and made $1 billion available for this 1975 program during Fiscal Year (FY) 2011. Accordingly, HUD is reinstating the regulations for the program, under the title of ``Emergency Homeowners' Loan Program,'' with such modifications as necessary to mirror the statutory changes to the Emergency Homeowners' Relief Act of 1975 made by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Credit Risk Retention
The OCC, Board, FDIC, Commission, FHFA, and HUD (the Agencies) are proposing rules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o- 11), as added by section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the Agencies by rule.

HUD Multifamily Rental Projects: Regulatory Revisions
This rule amends certain Federal Housing Administration (FHA) regulations to update these regulations to reflect current HUD policy in the area of multifamily rental projects. On November 12, 2010, HUD published proposed regulations to remove outdated regulatory language and policies and to reflect proposed changes in FHA's multifamily rental project closing documents, issued for comment in January 2010, and again in December 2010. The issuance of revised multifamily rental project closing documents for public comment and corresponding regulatory changes first commenced in 2004, but was not completed. This final rule follows the November 12, 2010 proposed rule, and takes into consideration public comments received on the November 2010 proposed rule, as well as certain comments received on HUD's issuance of further revised multifamily rental project closing documents made available for public comment by notice published on December 22, 2010. Neither the closing documents issued for comment in January 2010 and December 2010, nor this final rule include changes affecting closing documents or regulations for healthcare facilities, nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, board and care homes, and assisted living facilities.

Reducing Regulatory Burden; Retrospective Review Plans Under E.O. 13563
In accordance with Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' HUD has developed a preliminary review plan for periodically analyzing its existing significant regulations to determine whether they should be modified, streamlined, expanded, or repealed. The preliminary plan also identifies specific regulatory actions rules that HUD will be undertaking to address regulations that the Department has identified as being outdated, ineffective, or excessively burdensome. The preliminary plans of the Federal agencies have been posted on the White House Web site at: http://www.slideshare.net/whitehouse/hud-combined. Through this notice, HUD solicits public comment on the Department's preliminary plan and list of candidate rules. The purpose of HUD's regulatory review is to make the Department's regulations more effective and less burdensome in achieving HUD's mission to create strong, sustainable, inclusive communities, and quality affordable homes for all.

HUD Debt Collection: Revisions and Update to the Procedures for the Collection of Claims
This proposed rule would revise and update HUD's regulations governing the procedures for the collection of claims by HUD. This proposed rule would primarily revise HUD's debt collection regulations to implement the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCTA) and the revised Federal Claims Collection Standards (FCCS). The DCTA and FCCS generally apply to the collection of nontax debt owed to the Federal Government and require referral of all eligible delinquent nontax debt to the Department of the Treasury for collection by centralized offset and to a designated debt collection center for debt servicing when a debt becomes 180 days delinquent. This proposed rule would also update and make technical corrections to HUD's salary offset provisions to conform to the changes made to HUD's debt collection regulations.

This requirement was established by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. Although current HUD practice is in compliance with the statutory mandate, the regulations reflect outdated prior policy of permitting state-licensed appraisers to be listed on the FHA Appraiser Roster. In addition, HUD has taken this opportunity to update the FHA Appraiser Roster by replacing the obsolete references to the Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System with references to its successor, the online-based Credit Alert Verification Reporting System.

This rule proposes to revise HUD's existing regulations governing a physical needs assessment (PNA) undertaken by a public housing agency (PHA). A PNA identifies all of the work that a PHA would need to undertake to bring each of its projects up to the applicable modernization and energy conservation standards. This rule would require PHAs to project the current modernization and life-cycle replacement repair needs of its projects over a 20-year period, rather than a 5-year period, because the 20-year period coincides better with the useful life of individual properties and their building components and systems to ensure the long-term viability of the property. Additionally, this rule proposes to integrate the performance of the PNA with the performance of an energy audit.

This proposed rule would suspend FHA's mortgage insurance program for military impacted areas under section 238(c) of the National Housing Act (Act). This single-family mortgage insurance program, established by regulation in 1977, has been significantly underutilized for the past several years. Additionally, these mortgage loans are insured under comparable terms and conditions as loans insured under HUD's primary single-family mortgage insurance program under section 203(b) of the National Housing Act. Accordingly, those borrowers who would be served under section 238(c) of the Act are served equally well under the section 203(b) mortgage insurance program. The suspension of this mortgage insurance program is consistent with the President's budget request for Fiscal Year 2012.

Homeless Management Information Systems Requirements
This proposed rule provides for the establishment of regulations for Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), which are the local information technology systems that HUD recipients and subrecipients use for homeless assistance programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (the McKinney-Vento Act). The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act), enacted into law on May 20, 2009, in addition to consolidating and amending programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Act, codifies in law the Continuum of Care planning process, as well as certain data collection requirements integral to HMIS. The HEARTH Act requires that HUD ensure operation of and consistent participation by recipients and subrecipients in HMIS. While Continuums of Care have been using HMIS for several years, this proposed rule would add a new part to the Code of Federal Regulations to regulate the administration of HMIS and collection of data using HMIS, as provided for by the HEARTH Act.

Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands
This proposed rule would update and modify HUD's regulations governing the protection of wetlands and floodplains. With respect to wetlands, the proposed rule would codify existing procedures for Executive Order 11990 (E.O. 11990), Protection of Wetlands. HUD's current policy is to require the use of E.O. 11990's 8 Step Process for floodplains for actions performed by the Department or actions performed with HUD financial assistance. This rule will codify this policy and thereby improve consistency and increase transparency by placing the E.O. requirements in regulation. In certain instances, the new wetlands procedures will allow recipients of HUD assistance to use permits issued under section 404 of the Clean Water Act in lieu of five steps of the E.O. 11990's 8 Step Process, thereby streamlining the wetlands decision-making processes. With respect to floodplains, the proposed rule would prohibit HUD funding (e.g., Community Development Block Grants, HOME Investment Partnerships Program, Choice Neighborhoods, etc.) or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance for the construction of new structures in Coastal High Hazard Areas. The current regulations allow for such new construction so long as the construction, is in accordance with certain standards. This change is anticipated to have minimal effect, since HUD receives few requests to fund or insure mortgages for new construction in these areas. The proposal would also make several other changes to HUD's floodplain and wetland regulations; the changes are designed to streamline floodplain and wetland environmental procedures and avoid unnecessary delays in processing. The procedures proposed by this rule would apply to HUD and to state, tribal, and local governments when they are responsible for environmental reviews under HUD programs.

HOME Investment Partnerships Program: Improving Performance and Accountability; and Updating Property Standards
HUD's HOME Investment Partnerships Program (HOME program or HOME) provides formula grants to states and units of local government to fund a wide range of activities directed to producing or maintaining affordable housing, both homes and rental housing. This proposed rule would amend the HOME regulations to address many of the operational challenges facing participating jurisdictions, particularly challenges related to recent housing market conditions and the alignment of federal housing programs. The proposed rule would also clarify certain existing regulatory requirements and establish new requirements designed to enhance accountability by States and units of local government in the use of HOME funds, strengthen performance standards and require more timely housing production. The proposed rule would also update property standards applicable to housing assisted by HOME funds.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Temporary Exemption From Compliance With FHA's Regulation on Property Flipping Extension of Exemption
This notice announces that FHA is extending the availability of the temporary waiver of its regulation that prohibits the use of FHA financing to purchase single family properties that are being resold within 90 days of the previous acquisition, until December 31, 2012. This waiver, which was first issued in January 2010, took effect for all sales contracts executed on or after February 1, 2010, and was extended in February 2011. The waiver is set to expire on December 31, 2011, and therefore HUD is extending the waiver for another calendar year. Prior to the waiver, a mortgage was not eligible for FHA insurance if the contract of sale for the purchase of the property that is the subject of the mortgage is executed within 90 days of the prior acquisition by the seller and the seller does not come under any of the exemptions to this 90-day period that are specified in the regulation. As a result of the high foreclosures that have been taking place across the nation, FHA, through the regulatory waiver, encourages investors that specialize in acquiring and renovating properties to renovate foreclosed and abandoned homes with the objective of increasing the availability of affordable homes for first-time and other purchasers and helping to stabilize real estate prices as well as neighborhoods and communities where foreclosure activity has been high. While the waiver is available for the purpose of stimulating rehabilitation of foreclosed and abandoned homes, the waiver is applicable to all single family properties being resold within the 90-day period after prior acquisition, and was not limited to foreclosed properties. Additionally, the waiver is subject to certain conditions, and eligible mortgages must meet these conditions to take advantage of the waiver. The waiver is not applicable to mortgages insured under HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Program.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Single-Family Mortgage Insurance: Elimination of Requests for Alternative Mortgage Limits
This proposed rule would eliminate the process for requesting alternative FHA maximum mortgage amounts. HUD currently sets the area- based loan limits on a yearly basis and permits appeals of these loan limits. At the time the regulations permitting appeals were promulgated, there were no comprehensive, national databases of home sales transactions. As a result, HUD relied on sales data provided by interested parties in determining loan limits for certain areas. Today, however, HUD has available comprehensive direct sales transaction data and indirect home value data at the county level. In addition, since HUD began this new information collection on price trends at a county level, the number of parties utilizing the appeals process has gone from 105 for the 2008 loan limits to zero for the 2011 loan limits. For these reasons, HUD has determined that the regulations governing requests for alternative maximum mortgage amounts are outdated and unnecessarily disrupt HUD's loan limit determination process. The elimination of this appeals process would allow HUD to release its annual loan limits one month earlier than it has for the past three calendar years. This difference would provide more certainty in the mortgage lending market.

Equal Access to Housing in HUD Programs Regardless of Sexual Orientation or Gender Identity
Through this final rule, HUD implements policy to ensure that its core programs are open to all eligible individuals and families regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or marital status. This rule follows a January 24, 2011, proposed rule, which noted evidence suggesting that lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) individuals and families are being arbitrarily excluded from housing opportunities in the private sector. Such information was of special concern to HUD, which, as the Nation's housing agency, has the unique charge to promote the federal goal of providing decent housing and a suitable living environment for all. It is important not only that HUD ensure that its own programs do not involve discrimination against any individual or family otherwise eligible for HUD-assisted or -insured housing, but that its policies and programs serve as models for equal housing opportunity.

Removal of the Indian HOME Investment Partnerships Program Regulation
This final rule removes HUD's outdated regulations for the Indian HOME Investment Partnerships (Indian HOME) program. Under the Indian HOME program, HUD awarded funds competitively to eligible applicants to provide affordable housing. The Indian HOME program was replaced by the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program established under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996 (NAHASDA). However, HUD retained the Indian HOME program regulations because they continued to govern grants awarded prior to the enactment of NAHASDA. Since September 30, 1997, HUD has not awarded grants under the Indian HOME program and, therefore, the regulations are no longer necessary.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Suspension of Section 238(c) Single-Family Mortgage Insurance in Military Impacted Areas
On August 30, 2011, HUD published a proposed rule to suspend FHA's mortgage insurance program for military impacted areas under section 238(c) of the National Housing Act. This single-family mortgage insurance program, established by regulation in 1977, has been significantly underutilized for the past several years. Additionally, these mortgage loans are insured under comparable terms and conditions as loans insured under HUD's primary single-family mortgage insurance program under section 203(b) of the National Housing Act. Accordingly, those borrowers who would be served under section 238(c) of the National Housing Act are served equally well under the section 203(b) mortgage insurance program. The suspension of this mortgage insurance program is consistent with the President's budget requests for Fiscal Years (FYs) 2011 and 2012. In this final rule, HUD is adopting the proposed rule without change.

HUD is in the process of implementing another notice tightening the underwriting standards for mortgage loan transactions that are manually underwritten. This document addresses the third proposal; namely, the proposal to reduce the amount of closing costs a seller may pay on behalf of a homebuyer purchasing a home with financing insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). This document takes into consideration the public comments on the July 15, 2010, final rule regarding the proposed cap on ``seller concessions'' and revises the proposed cap in response.

Portability is a feature of the HCV program that allows an eligible family with a housing choice voucher to use that voucher to lease a unit anywhere in the United States where there is a public housing agency (PHA) operating an HCV program. The purpose of HUD's proposed changes to the portability regulations is to clarify requirements already established in the existing regulations and improve the process involved with processing portability requests to enable PHAs to better serve families and expand housing opportunities. It is HUD's intent to increase administrative efficiencies by eliminating confusing and obscure regulatory language in areas that are known to be troublesome.

This rule would streamline the requirements for mixed-finance developments by removing restrictions on the portions of developments not funded through capital advances, thereby lifting barriers on participation in the development of the projects, and eliminating burdensome funding requirements. These proposed amendments would attract private capital and the expertise of the private developer community to create attractive and affordable supportive housing developments for the elderly and for persons with disabilities. HUD is also taking this opportunity to improve and bring up to date certain regulations governing all Section 202 and Section 811 developments. These changes will permit broader flexibility in the design of Section 202/811 units, extend the duration of the availability of capital advance funds, and make a technical correction. This proposed rule is the first part of a larger regulatory effort to reform the Section 202 and Section 811 programs, which will include implementation of the changes made to these programs by the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 and the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2010.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Multifamily Accelerated Processing-Enhancing and Strengthening Multifamily Accelerated Processing
Multifamily Accelerated Processing (MAP) is a processing system introduced in 2000 as a pilot program to facilitate the accelerated processing of loan applications for FHA multifamily mortgage insurance, which generally involve the refinance, purchase, new construction, or rehabilitation of multifamily properties. These transactions are costly, complicated, and time-consuming to process. Prior to MAP, HUD field offices were encouraged to develop and test individual fast-track processing systems for use by qualified FHA- approved lenders that were experienced in processing loan applications for multifamily mortgages. The intent was to considerably reduce the processing time of applications. These test procedures included providing qualified lenders with the option of preparing FHA forms and undertaking preliminary underwriting for certain types of loan applications. Fast-track processing procedures developed by individual HUD offices that facilitated processing applications without sacrificing quality or increasing risk were consolidated into a national test of fast-track style processing of multifamily mortgage insurance applications under the name ``MAP.'' MAP has been administered to date through direct instructions to FHA-approved lenders under a MAP Guide. Given its experience to date with MAP, HUD believes the MAP accelerated processing procedures have been successful. To ensure the continued quality and efficiency of MAP procedures, HUD is codifying in regulations key provisions of MAP and introducing new provisions to strengthen MAP, to assure the integrity and competency of FHA-approved lenders as directed by the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009.

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA): Changes to the Section 8 Tenant-Based Voucher and Section 8 Project-Based Voucher Programs
HERA, enacted into law on July 30, 2008, made comprehensive and significant reforms to several HUD programs, including HUD's Public Housing, Section 8 Tenant-Based Voucher, and Project-Based Voucher programs. On November 24, 2008, HUD published a notice that provided information about the applicability of certain HERA provisions to these programs. The notice identified: (1) Those statutory provisions that are self-executing and required no action on the part of HUD for the program changes made by HERA to be implemented; and (2) those statutory provisions that require new regulations or regulatory changes by HUD for the HERA provisions to be implemented. The notice also offered the opportunity for public comment on the guidance provided. This proposed rule follows the November 24, 2008, notice for the purpose of establishing, in regulation, the reforms made to HERA as discussed in that notice, and to make other related regulatory changes. This proposed rule would make conforming changes to the regulations of the Section 8 Tenant-Based Voucher and Section 8 Project-Based Voucher programs to reflect the self-executing provisions of HERA, and would also amend the regulations required to implement those statutory provisions of HERA that are not self-implementing. Additionally, this rule would make such other changes for the purposes of updating certain regulations to reflect current practices, and clarifying other regulations which, based on experience, HUD determined would benefit from clarification. While the conforming and clarifying changes are not implementing new policy, HUD nevertheless welcomes comment on the clarity and comprehensibility of the language proposed to be codified. This rule also takes into consideration the two public comments received in response to issuance of the November 2008 notice, and solicits additional public comment. HERA changes affecting the public housing program are being addressed by separate rulemaking.

Revision to the Section 8 Management Assessment Program Lease-Up Indicator
This final rule amends HUD's regulations for the Section 8 Management Assessment program (SEMAP), by revising the process by which HUD measures and verifies performance under the SEMAP lease-up indicator. Specifically, HUD amends the existing regulation to reflect that assessment of a public housing agency's (PHA) leasing indicator will be based on a calendar year cycle, rather than a fiscal year cycle, which would increase administrative efficiencies for PHAs. This rule also clarifies that units assisted under the voucher homeownership option or occupied under a project-based housing assistance payments (HAP) contract are included in the assessment of PHA units leased.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Section 232 Healthcare Mortgage Insurance Program: Partial Payment of Claims
This proposed rule would amend the regulations governing FHA's Section 232 Healthcare Mortgage Insurance program (Section 232 program). The Section 232 program insures mortgage loans to facilitate the construction, substantial rehabilitation, purchase, and refinancing of nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, board and care homes, and assisted-living facilities. The amendments proposed by this rule would reduce risk to the FHA insurance fund by establishing the criteria and process by which FHA will accept and pay a partial payment of the claim under the FHA mortgage insurance contract. Through acceptance and payment of a partial payment of claim, FHA pays the lender a portion of the unpaid principal balance and recasts a portion of the mortgage under terms and conditions determined by FHA, as an alternative to the lender assigning the entire mortgage to HUD. Partial payment of claim would also allow FHA insured healthcare projects to continue operating and providing services.

Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing: Continuum of Care Program
The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act), enacted into law on May 20, 2009, consolidates three of the separate homeless assistance programs administered by HUD under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act into a single grant program, and revises the Emergency Shelter Grants program and renames it the Emergency Solutions Grants program. The HEARTH Act also codifies in law the Continuum of Care planning process, a longstanding part of HUD's application process to assist homeless persons by providing greater coordination in responding to their needs. The HEARTH Act also directs HUD to promulgate regulations for these new programs and processes. This interim rule focuses on regulatory implementation of the Continuum of Care program, including the Continuum of Care planning process. The existing homeless assistance programs that comprise the Continuum of Care program are the following: the Supportive Housing program, the Shelter Plus Care program, and the Moderate Rehabilitation/Single Room Occupancy (SRO) program. This rule establishes the regulations for the Continuum of Care program, and, through the establishment of such regulations, the funding made available for the Continuum of Care program in the statute appropriating Fiscal Year (FY) 2012 funding for HUD can more quickly be disbursed, consistent with the HEARTH Act requirements, and avoid any disruption in current Continuum of Care activities.

Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Department of Housing and Urban Development
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with the concurrence of the Office of Government Ethics (OGE), is finalizing the proposed rule to amend its existing Supplemental Standards of Ethical Conduct, which are regulations for HUD officers and employees that supplement OGE's Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (Standards). To ensure a comprehensive and effective ethics program at HUD, and to address ethical issues unique to HUD, this final rule reflects statutory changes that were enacted subsequent to the codification of HUD's Supplemental Standards of Conduct regulation in 1996. Significantly, this final rule reflects the transfer of general regulatory authority over the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation from HUD to the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA). This final rule also revises definitions used in HUD's Supplemental Standards of Conduct to reflect updated titles and positions and clarifies existing prohibitions on certain financial interests and outside employment to better guide employee conduct, while upholding the integrity of HUD in the administration of its programs. Finally, this final rule more clearly describes the role and responsibility of the HUD Office of Inspector General in the agency's ethics program. This rule follows publication of a March 14, 2012, proposed rule and considers public comment on the proposed rule, but makes no changes at this final rule stage.

Federal Housing Administration: Strengthening Risk Management Through Responsible FHA-Approved Lenders
As part of HUD's efforts to strengthen the risk management practices of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), HUD published a final rule on April 20, 2010, revising its regulations pertaining to the FHA-approval of mortgage lenders. The April 20, 2010, final rule increased the net worth requirement for FHA-approved lenders and mortgagees, eliminated HUD's approval of loan correspondents, and amended the general approval standards for lenders and mortgagees. This final rule makes several nonsubstantive clarifications and corrections to the provisions of the April 20, 2010, final rule. The changes will improve the clarity of HUD's regulatory requirements and, thereby, facilitate program participant compliance and improve HUD's ability to monitor and enforce its risk management regulations.

In 2010 through 2011, HUD commenced and completed the process of revising regulations applicable to, and closing documents used in, FHA insurance of multifamily rental projects, to reflect current policy and practices in the multifamily mortgage market. This final rule results from a similar process that was initiated in 2011 for revising and updating the regulations governing, and the transactional documents used in, the program for insurance of healthcare facilities under section 232 of the National Housing Act (Section 232 program).

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Temporary Waiver of FHA's Regulation on Property Flipping; Extension of Waiver
This notice of waiver extension announces that FHA is extending the availability of the temporary waiver of its regulation that prohibits the use of FHA financing to purchase single family properties that are being resold within 90 days of the previous acquisition, until December 31, 2014. This waiver, which was first issued in January 2010, took effect for all sales contracts executed on or after February 1, 2010. On January 28, 2011, FHA extended the waiver through calendar 2011. On December 28, 2011, FHA extended the waiver through calendar 2012. Prior to the waiver, a mortgage was not eligible for FHA insurance if the contract of sale for the purchase of the property that secured the mortgage was executed within 90 days of the prior acquisition by the seller, and the seller did not come under any of the exemptions to this 90-day period specified in the regulation. Through the regulatory waiver, FHA encourages investors that specialize in acquiring and renovating properties to renovate foreclosed and abandoned homes, with the objective of increasing the availability of affordable homes for first-time and other purchasers, helping to stabilize real estate prices as well as neighborhoods and communities where foreclosure activity has been high. The waiver is applicable to all single family properties being resold within the 90- day period after prior acquisition, and is not limited to foreclosed properties. Additionally, the waiver is subject to certain conditions, and mortgages must meet these conditions to be eligible for the waiver. The waiver is not applicable to mortgages insured under HUD's Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) Program.

HUD is issuing this interpretive rule to clarify the scope of the provision in the National Housing Act that prohibits certain sources of a homebuyer's funds for the required minimum cash investment for single family mortgages to be insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). Uncertainty has arisen as to the effect of this provision on State and local governments and their agencies' and instrumentalities' homeownership programs that provide funds for the minimum cash investment. This rule provides HUD's interpretation that this statutory provision does not remove the availability of FHA insurance for use in conjunction with State and local government programs that provide funds toward the required minimum cash investment. Although interpretive rules are exempt from public comment under the Administrative Procedure Act, HUD nevertheless invites public comment on the interpretation provided in this rule.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program-Refinancing Hospital Loans
This rule revises the regulations governing FHA's Section 242 Hospital Mortgage Insurance Program (Section 242 program) for the purpose of codifying, in regulation, FHA's implementation of its authority to refinance existing loans of hospitals without FHA-insured mortgages, without conditioning the exercise of such authority on the expenditure of funds for construction or renovation. Hospitals with FHA's Section 242 mortgage insurance may refinance existing debt under section 223(a)(7) of the National Housing Act, and such refinancing under section 223(a)(7) is not conditioned upon the hospital undertaking new construction or renovation. When credit availability contracted considerably in 2008, FHA, in 2009, commenced the exercise of its authority to refinance the capital debt of hospitals without section 242 mortgage insurance. FHA exercised this authority through notices issued on July 1, 2009, and February 22, 2010. FHA initiated rulemaking to make this refinancing authority a permanent part of the Section 242 regulatory program through a January 29, 2010, proposed rule, which solicited comment on HUD's implementation of this refinancing authority to date. This final rule provides for codification in regulation of HUD's refinancing of existing debt and acquisitions for non-FHA insured loans of hospitals without conditioning such refinancing and acquisition on new construction or renovation. This rule makes certain changes to the regulations proposed January 2010 in response to public comments submitted on the proposed rule and further consideration of issues by HUD.

Streamlining Inspection and Warranty Requirements for Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Single-Family Mortgage Insurance: Removal of the FHA Inspector Roster and of the Ten-Year Protection Plan Requirements for High Loan-to-Value Ratio Mortgages
This proposed rule would streamline the inspection and home warranty requirements for FHA single-family mortgage insurance. First, HUD proposes to remove the regulations for the FHA Inspector Roster (Roster). The Roster is a list of inspectors approved by FHA as eligible to determine if the construction quality of a one- to four- unit property is acceptable as security for an FHA-insured loan. HUD's regulations currently require the use of an inspector from the Roster as a condition for FHA mortgage insurance where the local jurisdiction does not perform necessary inspections. HUD's proposal to remove the Roster regulations is based on the recognition of the sufficiency and quality of inspections carried out by certified inspectors and other qualified individuals. Second, this proposed rule would also remove the regulations requiring 10-year protection plans in order to qualify for high loan- to-value (LTV), FHA-insured mortgages as a condition of closing for newly constructed single-family homes. The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) removed the statutory requirement for a warranty plan and other special requirements for high LTV mortgages. HUD, however, is retaining the requirement that the Warranty of Completion of Construction (form HUD-92544) be executed by the builder and the buyer of a new construction home, as a condition for FHA mortgage insurance.

Implementation of the Fair Housing Act's Discriminatory Effects Standard
Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended (Fair Housing Act or Act), prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental, or financing of dwellings and in other housing-related activities on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin.\1\ HUD, which is statutorily charged with the authority and responsibility for interpreting and enforcing the Fair Housing Act and with the power to make rules implementing the Act, has long interpreted the Act to prohibit practices with an unjustified discriminatory effect, regardless of whether there was an intent to discriminate. The eleven federal courts of appeals that have ruled on this issue agree with this interpretation. While HUD and every federal appellate court to have ruled on the issue have determined that liability under the Act may be established through proof of discriminatory effects, the statute itself does not specify a standard for proving a discriminatory effects violation. As a result, although HUD and courts are in agreement that practices with discriminatory effects may violate the Fair Housing Act, there has been some minor variation in the application of the discriminatory effects standard. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to proposing the regulatory framework for the new Rural Housing Stability Assistance program, this rule also proposes to establish a definition for ``chronically homeless'' that includes a definition of ``homeless occasion'' that better targets persons with the longest histories of homelessness and the highest level of need.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Approval of Lending Institutions and Mortgagees: Streamlined Reporting Requirements for Small Supervised Lenders and Mortgagees
This proposed rule would streamline the FHA financial statement reporting requirements for lenders and mortgagees who are supervised by federal banking agencies and whose consolidated assets do not meet the thresholds set by their supervising federal banking agencies for submission of audited financial statements (currently set at $500 million in consolidated assets). HUD's regulations currently require all supervised lenders and mortgagees to submit annual audited financial statements as a condition of FHA lender approval and recertification. Through this proposed rule, in lieu of the annual audited financial statements, small supervised lenders and mortgagees would be required to submit the unaudited financial regulatory reports that align with their fiscal year ends and are required to be submitted to their supervising federal banking agencies. Small supervised lenders and mortgagees would only be required to submit audited financial statements if HUD determines that the supervised lenders or mortgagees pose heightened risk to the FHA insurance fund. This rule does not impact FHA's annual audited financial statements submission requirement for nonsupervised and large supervised lenders and mortgagees. The rule also does not impact those supervised lenders and mortgagees with consolidated assets in an amount that requires that lenders or mortgagees submit audited financial statements to their respective supervising federal banking agencies. Finally, HUD has taken the opportunity afforded by this proposed rule to make three technical changes to current regulations regarding reporting requirements for FHA-approved supervised lenders and mortgagees.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Section 232 Healthcare Facility Insurance Program-Strengthening Accountability and Regulatory Revisions Update Final Rule Amendment-Revision of Date of Applicability
On September 7, 2012, HUD published a final rule that revised the regulations governing the insurance of healthcare facilities under section 232 of the National Housing Act (Section 232). HUD's Section 232 program insures mortgage loans to facilitate the construction, substantial rehabilitation, purchase, and refinancing of nursing homes, intermediate care facilities, board and care homes, and assisted-living facilities. The amendments made by the September 7, 2012, final rule updated the Section 232 regulations to reflect current policy and practices, improve accountability and strengthen risk management in the program. The final rule provided an applicability date of April 9, 2013, for certain of the updated requirements. This final rule amendment changes the applicability date to July 12, 2013, for the purpose of allowing more time to transition to the new requirements.

Pet Ownership for the Elderly or Persons With Disabilities in Multifamily Rental Housing; Accumulation of Deposits for Costs Attributable to Pets
HUD regulations governing multifamily rental housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities allow for the residents of such housing to own common household pets, subject to the residents' paying a refundable pet deposit. Currently, the regulations require that owners of HUD-assisted multifamily rental housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities collect the deposit and any increases in the deposit from the pet owner only through gradual accumulation; that is, an initial payment followed by subsequent monthly payments. This requirement does not exist for public housing agencies (PHAs) and owners of other HUD-assisted multifamily rental housing. Rather, HUD regulations provide PHAs and owners of other HUD-assisted multifamily rental housing discretion to determine whether to gradually accumulate a pet deposit and any increases to the pet deposit. This proposed rule would provide owners of HUD-assisted multifamily rental housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities, now subject to the gradual-accumulation pet deposit requirement, with the same flexibility, thereby bringing consistency to the pet deposit requirements for HUD programs and better enabling owners of such housing to handle the costs associated with pet ownership by tenants. This proposed rule only applies to policies for pets and not to service or assistance animals for persons with disabilities.

Streamlining Requirements Governing the Use of Funding for Supportive Housing for the Elderly and Persons With Disabilities Programs
This final rule amends HUD's regulations governing the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Program (Section 202) and the Section 811 Supportive Housing for Persons with Disabilities Program (Section 811) to streamline the requirements applicable to Section 202 and Section 811 mixed-finance developments. This rule removes restrictions on the portions of developments not funded through capital advances, lifts barriers on participation in the development of the projects, and eliminates burdensome funding requirements. These changes are anticipated to attract private capital and the expertise of the private developer community to create attractive and affordable supportive housing developments for the elderly and for persons with disabilities. Through this rule, HUD also brings up-to-date certain regulations governing all Section 202 and Section 811 developments, not solely mixed-finance developments. Overall, the changes made by this rule permit greater flexibility in the design of Section 202/811 units, and extend the duration of the availability of capital advance funds. This final rule is part of a larger effort to reform the Section 202 and Section 811 programs, which will include implementation of the changes made to these programs by the Frank Melville Supportive Housing Investment Act of 2010 and the Section 202 Supportive Housing for the Elderly Act of 2010. A subsequent rule, which will focus on the statutory changes that require rulemaking for implementation, is expected to be published in 2013.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Multifamily Mortgage Insurance; Capturing Excess Claim Proceeds
This proposed rule would amend HUD's regulations covering the contract rights and obligations of mortgagees participating in FHA multifamily mortgage insurance programs, to address reimbursement to FHA of excess claim proceeds. When a mortgagee finances mortgages through the issuance and sale of bonds or through bond anticipation notes, the mortgagee uses the FHA insurance claim funds to pay off the remaining bond debts. At times, the amount paid by the FHA insurance claim is greater than the remaining bond debts. This proposed rule would require mortgagees to return to FHA the excess bond funds that remain after FHA's payment is used to satisfy the bonds. HUD requires similar payments of excess bond funds on obligations of public housing agencies and, thus, the proposed rule would provide consistency in the administration of HUD's bond financing programs.

Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing
Through this rule, HUD proposes to provide HUD program participants with more effective means to affirmatively further the purposes and policies of the Fair Housing Act, which is Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968. The Fair Housing Act not only prohibits discrimination but, in conjunction with other statutes, directs HUD's program participants to take steps proactively to overcome historic patterns of segregation, promote fair housing choice, and foster inclusive communities for all. As acknowledged by the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and many stakeholders, advocates, and program participants, the current practice of affirmatively furthering fair housing carried out by HUD grantees, which involves an analysis of impediments to fair housing choice and a certification that the grantee will affirmatively further fair housing, has not been as effective as had been envisioned. This rule accordingly proposes to refine existing requirements with a fair housing assessment and planning process that will better aid HUD program participants fulfill this statutory obligation and address specific comments the GAO raised. To facilitate this new approach, HUD will provide states, local governments, insular areas, and public housing agencies (PHAs), as well as the communities they serve, with data on patterns of integration and segregation; racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty; access to education, employment, low-poverty, transportation, and environmental health, among other critical assets; disproportionate housing needs based on the classes protected under the Fair Housing Act; data on individuals with disabilities and families with children; and discrimination. From these data, program participants will evaluate their present environment to assess fair housing issues, identify the primary determinants that account for those issues, and set forth fair housing priorities and goals. The benefit of this approach is that these priorities and goals will then better inform program participant's strategies and actions by improving the integration of the assessment of fair housing through enhanced coordination with current planning exercises. This proposed rule further commits HUD to greater engagement and better guidance for program participants in fulfilling their obligation to affirmatively further fair housing. With this new clarity through guidance, a template for the assessment, and a HUD-review process, program participants should achieve more meaningful outcomes that affirmatively further fair housing.

Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the agencies by rule.

Qualified Mortgage Definition for HUD Insured and Guaranteed Single Family Mortgages
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) created new section 129C in the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA), which establishes minimum standards for considering a consumer's repayment ability for creditors originating certain closed- end, dwelling-secured mortgages, and generally prohibits a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good-faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Section 129C provides lenders more certainty about meeting the ability-to-repay requirements when lenders make ``qualified mortgages,'' which are presumed to meet the requirements. Section 129C authorizes the agency with responsibility for compliance with TILA, which was initially the Federal Reserve Board and is now the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), to issue a rule implementing these requirements. The CFPB has issued its rule implementing these requirements, referred to throughout this proposed rule as the CFPB final rule. The Dodd-Frank Act also charges HUD and three other Federal agencies with prescribing regulations defining the types of loans that these Federal agencies insure, guarantee, or administer, as applicable, that are qualified mortgages. Through this proposed rule, HUD submits for public comment its definition of ``qualified mortgage'' for the types of loans that HUD insures, guarantees, or administers that aligns with the statutory ability-to-repay criteria of TILA and the regulatory criteria of the CFPB's definition, without departing from HUD's statutory missions. In this rulemaking, HUD proposes that any forward single family mortgage insured or guaranteed by HUD shall meet the criteria of a qualified mortgage, as defined in this rule, and HUD seeks comment on all components of its definition.

This final rule amends HUD regulations that establish procedures for manufacturers and others to address reports of problems with manufactured homes. These ``Subpart I'' regulations establish a system of protections with respect to imminent safety hazards and violations of the federal construction and safety standards, assuring a minimum of formality and delay, while protecting the rights of all parties. This final rule establishes the procedures that manufacturers, retailers, distributors, State Administrative Agencies (SAAs), and primary inspection agencies (PIAs), are required to follow to assure that notification and correction are provided with respect to manufactured homes, when required.

Public Housing Capital Fund Program
This final rule combines and streamlines the former legacy public housing modernization programs, including the Comprehensive Grant Program (CGP), the Comprehensive Improvement Assistance Program (CIAP), and the Public Housing Development Program (which encompasses mixed-finance development), into the Capital Fund Program (CFP). This rule defines qualified PHAs, which are not required to file annual plans. The rule expands HUD's current requirement that a Public Housing Authority (PHA) submit a physical needs assessment (PNA) to include small PHAs as well as large PHAs, but provides small PHAs additional time to plan for and implement this requirement. The rule allows PHAs to request a total development cost (TDC) exception for integrated utility management, capital planning, and other capital and management activities that promote energy conservation and efficiency, including green construction and retrofits, which include windows; heating system replacements; wall insulation; site-based generation; advanced energy savings technologies, including renewable energy generation; and other such retrofits. The rule also makes changes to replacement housing factor funds and the threshold for management improvements. Because this rule streamlines programs, several formerly separate regulations are eliminated with the implementation of this rule.

Housing Counseling Program: New Certification Requirements; Extension of Public Comment Period

Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands
This final rule revises HUD's regulations governing the protection of wetlands and floodplains. With respect to wetlands, the rule codifies existing procedures for Executive Order 11990 (E.O. 11990), Protection of Wetlands. HUD's policy has been to require the use of the 8-Step Process for floodplains for wetlands actions performed by HUD or actions performed with HUD financial assistance. This rule codifies this wetlands policy and improves consistency and increases transparency by placing the E.O. 11990 requirements in regulation. In certain instances, the new wetlands procedures will allow recipients of HUD assistance to use individual permits issued under section 404 of the Clean Water Act (Section 404 permits) in lieu of 5 steps of the E.O. 11990's 8-Step Process, streamlining the wetlands decisionmaking processes. With respect to floodplains, with some exceptions, the rule prohibits HUD funding (e.g., Community Development Block Grants, HOME Investment Partnerships Program, Choice Neighborhoods, and others) or Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage insurance for construction in Coastal High Hazard Areas. In order to ensure maximum protection for communities and wise investment of Federal resources in the face of current and future risk, this final rule also requires the use of preliminary flood maps and advisory base flood elevations where the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has determined that existing Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) may not be the ``best available information'' for floodplain management purposes. This change in map usage requirements brings HUD's regulations into alignment with the requirement in Executive Order 11988 that agencies are to use the ``best available information'' and will provide greater consistency with floodplain management activities across HUD and FEMA programs. The rule also streamlines floodplain and wetland environmental procedures to avoid unnecessary processing delays. The procedures set forth in this rule would apply to HUD and to state, tribal, and local governments when they are responsible for environmental reviews under HUD programs.

Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards
This final rule amends the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards by adopting certain recommendations made to HUD by the Manufactured Housing Consensus Committee (MHCC), as modified by HUD. The National Manufactured Housing Construction and Safety Standards Act of 1974 (the Act) requires HUD to publish in the Federal Register all proposed revised construction and safety standards (Construction and Safety Standards, or Standards) submitted by the MHCC. The MHCC prepared and submitted to HUD its second group of recommendations to improve various aspects of the Construction and Safety Standards. HUD is including a number of revisions in this final rule to reflect recent changes to code standards adopted by private standard-setting organizations and recommended by the MHCC or members of the public. However, HUD has decided at this time not to go forward in this final rule with certain revisions contained in the proposed rule due to pending regulations for improving energy efficiency in manufactured homes currently being prepared by the Department of Energy (DOE). HUD has also decided not to move forward with its proposal to establish maximum formaldehyde emissions standards for particleboard materials used in Manufactured Housing flooring applications so that HUD can consider standards for formaldehyde being established by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under the Toxic Substances Control Act.

Floodplain Management and Protection of Wetlands; Correction
HUD is correcting a final rule published in the Federal Register on November 15, 2013. The November 15, 2013, final rule revised HUD's regulations governing the protection of wetlands and floodplains. Upon publication, HUD discovered that it inadvertently duplicated an activity that the final rule exempts from the 8 Step Process for floodplains and wetlands management compliance. As a result, this document corrects this duplication by removing the duplication.

Qualified Mortgage Definition for HUD Insured and Guaranteed Single Family Mortgages
Through this final rule, HUD establishes a definition of ``qualified mortgage'' for the single family residential loans that HUD insures, guarantees, or administers that aligns with the statutory ability-to-repay criteria of the Truth-in-Lending Act (TILA) and the regulatory criteria of the definition of ``qualified mortgage'' promulgated by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) created new section 129C in TILA, which establishes minimum standards for considering a consumer's repayment ability for creditors originating certain closed-end, dwelling-secured mortgages, and generally prohibits a creditor from making a residential mortgage loan unless the creditor makes a reasonable and good-faith determination of a consumer's ability to repay the loan according to its terms. Section 129C authorizes the agency with responsibility for compliance with TILA, which is CFPB, to issue a rule implementing these requirements, and the CFPB has issued its rule implementing these requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act also charges HUD and three other Federal agencies with prescribing regulations defining the types of loans that these Federal agencies insure, guarantee, or administer, as may be applicable, that are qualified mortgages. Through this rule, HUD complies with this statutory directive for the single family residential loans that HUD insures, guarantees, or administers.

Responsibilities of Boards of Directors, Corporate Practices and Corporate Governance Matters
The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) is proposing to amend its regulations by relocating and consolidating certain Federal Housing Finance Board (Finance Board) and Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) regulations that pertain to the responsibilities of boards of directors, corporate practices, and corporate governance matters. The OFHEO regulations address corporate governance matters at the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Enterprises), while the Finance Board regulations address the powers and responsibilities of the boards of directors and management of the Federal Home Loan Banks (Banks). The proposed rule would consolidate most of those existing regulations into a new FHFA regulation, parts of which would apply to both the Banks and the Enterprises (together, regulated entities), and parts of which would apply only to the Banks or only to the Enterprises. Most of the content of the new regulation has been derived from the existing regulations, with such modifications as are necessary to apply certain provisions to all regulated entities. The proposal also would include a new provision on risk management and a new definition of ``credit risk,'' which is a term that is used only within the proposed risk management provision. Those provisions would apply to both the Banks and the Enterprises. FHFA also is proposing to amend a definition within its Prudential Management and Operations Standards (Prudential Standards) regulations and the introductory language to the standards themselves. Together, those amendments would explicitly include certain introductory language--pertaining to the general responsibilities of senior management and boards of directors--as part of the standards. The proposed rule also would repeal a separate provision of the OFHEO regulations that relate to minimum safety and soundness requirements.

Environmental Compliance Recordkeeping Requirements
This proposed rule would revise the regulations governing the format used for conducting the required environmental reviews for HUD program and policy actions. HUD's current regulations require that HUD staff document part 50 environmental review compliance using form HUD- 4128. Recipients receiving HUD assistance and other entities responsible for conducting part 58 environmental reviews (``responsible entities'') are currently allowed to use either HUD-recommended formats or develop equivalent formats for documenting environmental review compliance. The reference to a specific form number in part 50 restricts HUD's ability to adopt alternative form designations and forms, while authorizing the use of alternate forms in part 58 makes it difficult for HUD to assess, compare, and collect data on responsible entities' environmental review records. Despite being applicable to different parties, environmental review responsibilities under parts 50 and 58 are substantively similar. In light of that, the proposed rule would give the Departmental Environmental Clearance Officer (DECO) the authority to create one standardized format for use in both part 50 and part 58 reviews and authorize exceptions, thereby eliminating unnecessary distinctions between reviews completed by HUD employees and responsible entities. This proposed rule would also make a technical amendment to part 58 by making the regulations consistent with the ``Environmental Assessment'' definition provided in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) (NEPA).

This final rule revises the regulations governing the Section 184 Indian Housing Loan Guarantee program (Section 184 program) to conform to a recent statutory change. The 2013 Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act amends section 184(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 by authorizing HUD to increase the fee for the guarantee of Section 184 loans up to 3 percent of the principal obligation of the loan and to establish the amount of the fee by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. This final rule amends the Section 184 Indian Housing Loan Guarantee Program regulations to reflect this new authority. By notice published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, HUD is exercising this authority to increase the loan guarantee fee to 1.5 percent of the principal obligation from the current rate of 1 percent.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Adjustable Rate Mortgage Notification Requirements and Look-Back Period for FHA-Insured Single Family Mortgages
This rule proposes two revisions to FHA's regulations governing its single family adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) program to align FHA interest rate adjustment and notification regulations with the requirements for notifying mortgagors of ARM adjustments, as required by the regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), as recently revised by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The first proposed amendment of this rule would require that an interest rate adjustment resulting in a corresponding change to the mortgagor's monthly payment for an ARM be based on the most recent index value available 45 days before the date of the rate adjustment. The date that the newly adjusted interest rate goes into effect is often referred to as the ``interest change date.'' The number of days prior to the interest change date on which the index value is selected is called the ``look-back period.'' FHA's current regulations provide for a 30-day look-back period. The second proposed amendment would require that the mortgagee of an FHA-insured ARM comply with the disclosure and notification requirements of the 2013 TILA Servicing Rule, including at least a 60-day but no more than 120-day advance notice of an adjustment to a mortgagor's monthly payment. FHA's current regulations provide for notification at least 25 days in advance of an adjustment to a mortgagor's monthly payment.

Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Disability in Federally Assisted Programs and Activities
HUD is issuing this document to permit recipients of Federal financial assistance from HUD (HUD recipients) to use an alternative accessibility standard for purposes of complying with Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and HUD's implementing regulation at 24 CFR part 8 (Section 504 regulation) until HUD formally revises its Section 504 regulation to adopt an updated accessibility standard. In March 2011, the Department of Justice (DOJ), pursuant to its coordination authority under Section 504, advised Federal agencies that they may permit covered entities to use the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design (2010 Standards) as an acceptable alternative to the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards (UFAS) until such time as they update their agency's regulation implementing the Federally assisted provisions of Section 504. Consistent with DOJ's advice, this document provides HUD recipients the option of using the 2010 Standards under title II of the ADA, except for certain specific provisions identified in this document, as an alternative accessibility standard to UFAS for purposes of complying with Section 504 and HUD's Section 504 regulation for new construction and alterations commenced on or after May 23, 2014. This document is in effect until HUD formally revises its Section 504 regulation to adopt an updated accessibility standard.

Manufactured Housing Constructions and Safety Standards: Correction of Reference Standard for Anti-Scald Valves
This final rule amends the Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards by incorporating the correct reference standard for anti-scald devices designed for bathtubs and whirlpool tubs without showers, ASSE 1070-2004, Performance Requirements for Water Temperature Limiting Devices. Anti-scald valves mitigate the danger of serious burns and other hazards caused by bursts of hot water resulting from sudden changes in water pressure. In a final rule published on December 9, 2013, HUD incorporated ASSE 1016- 2005, an anti-scalding device designed for showers and tub-shower combinations. HUD failed to incorporate, however, ASSE 1070-2004, which is designed for fixtures such as bathtubs and whirlpool tubs that do not have showers. To correct this and ensure the safety of occupants of manufactured homes with bathtubs and whirlpool tubs without showers, this final rule incorporates ASSE 1070-2004.

Amendments To Reflect Change of Office Name From Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control to Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes
HUD's civil money penalty regulations currently provide that the Director of HUD's Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control, or the Director's designee, may initiate a civil money penalty action against any person who knowingly violates the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992. HUD's Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention regulation identifies the Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control as the approval authority, after consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, for lead-safe work practices courses that may qualify supervisors and workers to perform interim controls of lead-based paint hazards. Because HUD has changed the name of the Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control to the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes, this final rule conforms HUD regulations to reference this new name. This final rule also provides a savings provision that preserves under the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes all actions taken under the Office of Healthy Homes and Lead Hazard Control.

HUD Implementation of Fiscal Year 2014 Appropriations Provisions on Public Housing Agency Consortia, Biennial Inspections, Extremely Low-Income Definition, and Utility Allowances
Section 243 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Act, 2014 (2014 Appropriations Act) authorizes HUD to implement certain statutory changes to the United States Housing Act of 1937 made by the 2014 Appropriations Act through notice followed by notice and comment rulemaking. This notice establishes the terms and conditions by which HUD will implement changes to the statutory definition of a ``public housing agency'' (PHA), the frequency of housing inspections, the statutory definition of ``extremely low- income,'' and utility allowances for tenant-paid utilities.

The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA): Changes to the Section 8 Tenant-Based Voucher and Section 8 Project-Based Voucher Programs
HERA, enacted into law on July 30, 2008, made comprehensive and significant reforms to several HUD programs, including HUD's Public Housing, Section 8 Tenant-Based Voucher, and Project-Based Voucher programs. On November 24, 2008, HUD published a notice that provided information about the applicability of certain HERA provisions to these programs. The notice identified: those statutory provisions that are self-executing and required no action on the part of HUD for the program changes made by HERA to be implemented; and those statutory provisions that require new regulations or regulatory changes by HUD for the HERA provisions to be implemented. The notice also offered the opportunity for public comment on the guidance provided. HUD followed the November 2008 notice with a May 15, 2012, rule that proposed to establish, in regulation, the reforms made by HERA solely to the Section 8 Tenant-Based Voucher and Project-Based Voucher programs as discussed in the November 2008 notice, to make other related changes to the regulations, and to further solicit public comment. This final rule conforms the regulations of the Section 8 Tenant-Based Voucher and Project-Based Voucher programs to the statutory program changes made by HERA, makes other related changes to these regulations as discussed in the May 2012 proposed rule, and makes further changes to the two voucher program regulations as a result of issues raised by public comment or as a result of further consideration by HUD of issues pertaining to these programs.

Streamlining Requirements Applicable to Formation of Consortia by Public Housing Agencies
This proposed rule would revise HUD's public housing agency (PHA) consortium regulations. These regulations provide the procedures by which PHAs may choose to administer their public housing and Section 8 programs. The changes proposed are intended to increase administrative efficiencies associated with forming a consortium and to help ensure maximum family choice in locating suitable housing. The proposed rule focuses mainly on establishing a new category of consortia for administration of the Section 8 Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. This type of consortium would be comprised of multiple PHAs that would become a single PHA, with a single jurisdiction and a single set of reporting and audit requirements, for purposes of administering the Section 8 HCV program. This type of consortium would be in addition to the consortium structure established in current consortium regulations which the Department is referring to as multiple-ACC consortium in this proposed rule. The proposed rule would also revise the categories of Section 8 programs eligible to be administered under a consortium, and establish new requirements regarding the timeframes for the establishment and dissolution of a consortium. Further, HUD has taken the opportunity afforded by this proposed rule to make several technical, nonsubstantive changes to improve the clarity and organization of the consortia regulations. HUD has also taken the opportunity afforded by this proposed rule to amend the definition of ``public housing agency'' to be consistent with amendments to the United States Housing Act of 1937 (1937 Act), as provided for in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2014.

Removal of HOPE for Homeowners Program Regulations
Through this rule, HUD removes regulations for the HOPE for Homeowners Program. The statutory authority for this program expired September 30, 2011. Because these regulations are no longer operative, they are being removed by this final rule. To the extent that local programs are still ongoing under the following repealed parts, the removal of these regulations does not affect the requirements for transactions entered into when the regulations were in effect. Loans made under the HOPE for Homeowners Program that are presently insured will continue to be governed by the regulations that existed immediately before the effective date of this final rule.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Refinancing an Existing Cooperative Under Section 207 Pursuant to Section 223(f) of the National Housing Act
This final rule amends HUD's regulations governing the eligibility for FHA insurance of mortgages used for the purchase or refinancing of existing multifamily housing projects. Although the statutory language authorizing such insurance does not distinguish between rental or cooperative multifamily projects, HUD's regulations limit FHA insurance to existing rental projects. Given the significant needs identified for multifamily cooperative financing, the Department determined that it was appropriate to reconsider the regulatory imposed limitation. Accordingly, this rule revises HUD's regulations to enable existing multifamily cooperative project owners to obtain FHA insurance for the refinancing of existing indebtedness.

Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Multifamily Mortgage Insurance; Capturing Excess Bond Proceeds
This final rule amends HUD's regulations covering the contract rights and obligations of mortgagees participating in FHA multifamily mortgage insurance programs, to address reimbursement to FHA of excess bond proceeds. When a mortgagee finances mortgages through the issuance and sale of bonds or through bond anticipation notes, the mortgagee uses the funds from the payment of a mortgage insurance claim under HUD regulations addressing FHA multifamily insurance claim payment to pay off the remaining bond debts. At times, the amount paid by the FHA multifamily insurance claim is greater than the remaining bond debts. This final rule requires mortgagees that finance a project using a project-specific trust indenture agreement to include language in the trust indenture to require that excess bond funds that remain after FHA's multifamily insurance claim payment is used to satisfy the bonds are returned to FHA. HUD requires similar payments of excess bond funds on obligations of public housing agencies and, thus, the final rule provides consistency in the administration of HUD's bond-financed mortgages.

Environmental Compliance Recordkeeping Requirements
This final rule revises the regulations governing the format used for conducting the required environmental reviews for HUD program and policy actions. HUD's current regulations require that HUD staff document environmental review compliance using form HUD-4128. Recipients receiving HUD assistance and other entities responsible for conducting environmental reviews (responsible entities) are currently allowed to either use HUD-recommended formats or develop equivalent formats for documenting environmental review compliance. The reference to a specific form number in part 50 restricts HUD's ability to adopt alternative form designations and forms, while authorizing the use of alternate forms makes it difficult for HUD to assess, compare, and collect data on responsible entities' environmental review records. Despite being applicable to different parties, environmental review responsibilities under parts 50 and 58 are substantively similar. In light of that, the final rule gives the Departmental Environmental Clearance Officer (DECO) the authority to create one standardized format for use in reviews and authorize exceptions, thereby eliminating unnecessary distinctions between reviews completed by HUD employees and responsible entities. This final rule also makes a technical amendment by making the steps required to prepare an environmental assessment in HUD's regulations consistent with the ``Environmental Assessment'' definition provided in the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations implementing the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).

The final rule requires that an interest rate adjustment resulting in a corresponding change to the mortgagor's monthly payment for an ARM have a 45-day look-back period. The final rule also requires that the mortgagee of an FHA-insured ARM comply with the disclosure and notification requirements of the 2013 TILA Servicing Rule, including at least a 60- day but no more than 120 day advance notice of an adjustment to a mortgagor's monthly payment.

In accordance with Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' HUD reviewed its regulations to identify regulations that are ``outmoded, ineffective, insufficient or excessively burdensome.'' Following its review, HUD determined that the CPD regulations removed by this final rule are obsolete and unnecessary because they govern programs that are no longer funded or have been consolidated into other programs. No new grants or grant agreements making designations are being made under the regulations being removed. Existing grants or grant agreements entered into under the regulations being removed by this rule will continue to be governed by the regulations that existed immediately before the effective date of this final rule.

This final rule amends the Manufactured Home Model Installation Standards by revising existing requirements for ground anchor installations and establishing standardized test methods to determine ground anchor performance and resistance. The performance of conventional ground anchor assemblies is critical to the overall quality and structural integrity of manufactured housing installations. Because there was no generally accepted method for rating and certifying ground anchors, states had adopted different requirements for certifying ground anchor performance. This final rule establishes a uniform test method that can be utilized to determine and rate ground anchor performance in different soil classifications and may be used by states to certify and accept ground anchor assemblies.

In the discussion of implementation of the new definition of ``extremely low-income'' applicable to multifamily projects administered by HUD's Office of Housing, the document referred to ``contract administrators'' and it should have referenced ``owners.''

Federal Housing Administration (FHA): Section 232 Healthcare Facility Insurance Program-Aligning Operator Financial Reports With HUD's Uniform Financial Reporting Standards
Through a final rule published on September 7, 2012, HUD revised the regulations for FHA's program for insurance of health care facilities under section 232 of the National Housing Act (Section 232 program). In the September 7, 2012, final rule, HUD retained the longstanding requirement that owners and borrowers participating in the Section 232 program submit audited financial statements to HUD, and added the requirement that operators of Section 232 facilities also submit financial statements to HUD on a quarterly and annual basis. However, the September 7, 2012, rule placed operators on a different submission deadline than that required of owners. This interim rule revises the financial reporting deadlines for operators to bring them in-line with the reporting periods prescribed in HUD's Uniform Financial Reporting Standards, to which owners and borrowers are subject.

The purpose of the Committee is to develop regulatory changes to the funding formula for the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) program authorized by the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act of 1996. As part of its charter, the Committee is reviewing whether the current data source for the needs variables, which is the U.S. Decennial Census, should be updated or revised. HUD and the Committee are considering all relevant data sources, including the American Community Survey (ACS), and how each data source might be used or modified, to serve as the source of the data upon which the needs variables of the IHBG formula would be based. This Request for Information requests interested members of the public to provide information regarding alternate data sources, including ACS, which might serve as the basis upon which the needs variables of the IHBG formula could be based.
