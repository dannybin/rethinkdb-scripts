Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks
The Board of Governors (Board) is amending the routing number guide to next-day availability checks and local checks in Regulation CC to delete the reference to the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and to reassign the Federal Reserve routing symbols currently listed under that office to the head office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. These amendments reflect the restructuring of check-processing operations within the Federal Reserve System. Subsequent to these amendments, there will only be a single check- processing region for purposes of Regulation CC and there will no longer be any checks that are nonlocal.

Fair Credit Reporting Risk-Based Pricing Regulations
The Board and the Commission are jointly issuing final rules to implement the risk-based pricing provisions in section 311 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The final rules generally require a creditor to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer when the creditor uses a consumer report to grant or extend credit to the consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that creditor. The final rules also provide for two alternative means by which creditors can determine when they are offering credit on material terms that are materially less favorable. The final rules also include certain exceptions to the general rule, including exceptions for creditors that provide a consumer with a disclosure of the consumer's credit score in conjunction with additional information that provides context for the credit score disclosure.

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines; Capital Adequacy Guidelines; Capital Maintenance: Regulatory Capital; Impact of Modifications to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; Consolidation of Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Programs; and Other Related Issues
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the agencies) are amending their general risk- based and advanced risk-based capital adequacy frameworks by adopting a final rule that eliminates the exclusion of certain consolidated asset- backed commercial paper programs from risk-weighted assets; provides for an optional two-quarter implementation delay followed by an optional two-quarter partial implementation of the effect on risk- weighted assets that will result from changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; provides for an optional two-quarter delay, followed by an optional two-quarter phase-in, of the application of the agencies' regulatory limit on the inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) in tier 2 capital for the portion of the ALLL associated with the assets a banking organization consolidates as a result of changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and provides a reservation of authority to permit the agencies to require a banking organization to treat entities that are not consolidated under accounting standards as if they were consolidated for risk-based capital purposes, commensurate with the risk relationship of the banking organization to the structure. The delay and subsequent phase-in periods of the implementation will apply only to the agencies' risk-based capital requirements, not the leverage ratio requirement.

Therefore, the Board is withdrawing the January 2009 Regulation Z Rule as unnecessary.

The rule establishes a number of new substantive and disclosure requirements to establish fair and transparent practices pertaining to open-end consumer credit plans, including credit card accounts. In particular, the rule limits the application of increased rates to existing credit card balances, requires credit card issuers to consider a consumer's ability to make the required payments, establishes special requirements for extensions of credit to consumers who are under the age of 21, and limits the assessment of fees for exceeding the credit limit on a credit card account.

Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices
On January 29, 2009, the Board published a final rule amending Regulation AA and the staff commentary to the regulation. The substantive requirements in the January 2009 Regulation AA Rule, which were scheduled to go into effect on July 1, 2010, have been superseded by provisions of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (Credit Card Act) that go into effect on February 22, 2010. Elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register, the Board is implementing these Credit Card Act provisions in a new final rule amending Regulation Z. Accordingly, in order to avoid duplication and inconsistency, the Board is further amending Regulation AA to remove the substantive requirements in the January 2009 Regulation AA Rule. For procedural reasons, these requirements will be removed effective July 1, 2010. However, it is the Board's intent that the substantive requirements of the January 2009 Regulation AA Rule will not take effect. The Board issued its January 2009 Regulation AA Rule jointly with rules issued by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). This final rule applies only to the Board's Regulation AA and does not affect the rules issued by the OTS and NCUA.

Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions Policy on Payment System Risk
The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to authorize Reserve Banks to offer term deposits. Term deposits are intended to facilitate the conduct of monetary policy by providing a tool for managing the aggregate quantity of reserve balances. Institutions eligible to receive earnings on their balances in accounts at Federal Reserve Banks (``eligible institutions'') may hold term deposits and receive earnings at a rate that does not exceed the general level of short-term interest rates. Term deposits are separate and distinct from balances maintained in an institution's master account at a Reserve Bank (``master account'') as well as from those maintained in an excess balance account. Term deposits do not satisfy an institution's required reserve balance or contractual clearing balance and do not constitute excess balances. Term deposits are not available to clear payments and may not be used to reduce an institution's daylight or overnight overdrafts. The Board is also making minor amendments to the posting rules for intraday debits and credits to master accounts as set forth in the Board's Policy on Payment System Risk to address transactions associated with term deposits.

Community Reinvestment Act Regulations
The OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the OTS (collectively, ``the agencies'') are issuing this proposed rule to revise provisions of our rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The agencies propose to revise the term ``community development'' to include loans, investments, and services by financial institutions that support, enable, or facilitate projects or activities that meet the criteria described in Section 2301(c)(3) of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) and are conducted in designated target areas identified in plans approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, established pursuant to the HERA and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The proposed rule would provide favorable CRA consideration to such activities that, pursuant to the requirements of the program, benefit low-, moderate-, and middle-income individuals and geographies in designated target areas. Such consideration would include covered activities within an institution's assessment area(s) and outside of its assessment area(s), as long as the institution has adequately addressed the community development needs of its assessment area(s). As proposed, favorable consideration under the new rule would only be available until no later than two years after the last date appropriated funds for the program are required to be spent by the grantees. The agencies will provide reasonable advance notice to institutions in the Federal Register regarding termination of the rule once a date certain has been identified.

Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Alternatives to the Use of Credit Ratings in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Federal Banking Agencies
The regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the agencies) include various references to and requirements based on the use of credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), enacted on July 21, 2010, requires the agencies to review their regulations that require the use of an assessment of creditworthiness of a security or money market instrument and make reference to, or have requirements regarding, credit ratings. The agencies must then modify their regulations to remove any reference to, or requirements of reliance on, credit ratings in such regulations and substitute in their place other standards of creditworthiness that the agencies determine to be appropriate for such regulations. This advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) describes the areas in the agencies' risk-based capital standards and Basel changes that could affect those standards that make reference to credit ratings and requests comment on potential alternatives to the use of credit ratings.

Regulation Z; Truth in Lending
The Board is publishing for comment a proposed rule to amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The proposed rule would implement Section 1461 of the recently enacted Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Section 1461 amends TILA to provide a separate, higher threshold for determining coverage of the Board's escrow requirement applicable to higher-priced mortgage loans, for loans that exceed the maximum principal balance eligible for sale to Freddie Mac.

Regulation Z; Truth in Lending
The Board is publishing final rules amending Regulation Z (Truth in Lending). The final rule implements Section 131(g) of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), which was enacted on May 20, 2009, as Section 404(a) of the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act. TILA Section 131(g) became effective immediately upon enactment and established a new requirement for notifying consumers of the sale or transfer of their mortgage loans. Consistent with the statute, the final rule requires a purchaser or assignee that acquires a loan to provide the disclosures in writing no later than 30 days after the date on which the loan was sold, transferred or assigned. Certain exceptions may apply if the covered person transfers or assigns the loan to another party on or before the 30th day.

Regulation Z; Truth in Lending
The Board proposes to amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and the staff commentary to the regulation, as part of a comprehensive review of TILA's rules for home- secured credit. This proposal would revise the rules for the consumer's right to rescind certain open-end and closed-end loan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. In addition, the proposal contains revisions to the rules for determining when a modification of an existing closed-end mortgage loan secured by real property or a dwelling is a new transaction requiring new disclosures. The proposal would amend the rules for determining whether a closed-end loan secured by the consumer's principal dwelling is a ``higher-priced'' mortgage loan subject to the special protections in Sec. 226.35. The proposal would provide consumers with a right to a refund of fees imposed during the three business days following the consumer's receipt of early disclosures for closed-end loans secured by real property or a dwelling. The proposal also would amend the disclosure rules for open- and closed-end reverse mortgages. In addition, the proposal would prohibit certain unfair acts or practices for reverse mortgages. A creditor would be prohibited from conditioning a reverse mortgage on the consumer's purchase of another financial or insurance product such as an annuity, and a creditor could not extend a reverse mortgage unless the consumer has obtained counseling. The proposal also would amend the rules for reverse mortgage advertising.

Regulation Z; Truth in Lending
The Board is publishing for comment an interim rule amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The interim rule implements certain requirements of the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008, which amended TILA. The amendments and this interim rule require creditors extending consumer credit secured by real property or a dwelling to disclose certain summary information about interest rates and payment changes, in a tabular format, as well as a statement that consumers are not guaranteed to be able to refinance their transactions in the future. The interest rate and payment summary tables replace the payment schedule previously required as part of the TILA disclosure for mortgage transactions. Disclosures for non-mortgage, closed-end consumer credit will continue to include the current payment schedule.

Truth in Lending
The Board is publishing final rules amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act and Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act. The purpose of the final rule is to protect consumers in the mortgage market from unfair or abusive lending practices that can arise from certain loan originator compensation practices, while preserving responsible lending and sustainable homeownership. The final rule prohibits payments to loan originators, which includes mortgage brokers and loan officers, based on the terms or conditions of the transaction other than the amount of credit extended. The final rule further prohibits any person other than the consumer from paying compensation to a loan originator in a transaction where the consumer pays the loan originator directly. The Board is also finalizing the rule that prohibits loan originators from steering consumers to consummate a loan not in their interest based on the fact that the loan originator will receive greater compensation for such loan. The final rules apply to closed-end transactions secured by a dwelling where the creditor receives a loan application on or after April 1, 2011.

The rule implements the statutory requirement that the Agencies consider low-cost education loans provided by the financial institution to low-income borrowers as a factor when assessing an institution's record of meeting community credit needs. The final rule also incorporates the statutory provision that allows the Agencies to consider capital investment, loan participation, and other ventures undertaken by nonminority-owned and nonwomen-owned financial institutions in cooperation with minority- and women-owned financial institutions and low-income credit unions as a factor when assessing an institution's CRA record.

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is issuing a final rule to amend its regulation implementing the Privacy Act of 1974 (Privacy Act). The primary changes concern the waiver of copying fees charged to current and former Board employees, and applicants for Board employment, for access to their records under the Privacy Act; the amendment of special procedures for the release of medical records to permit the Board's Chief Privacy Officer to consult with the Board's Employee Assistance Program counselor to determine whether the disclosure of medical records directly to the requester could have an adverse effect on the requester; changes to the time limits for responding to requests for access to information and amendment of records; and updates to the exemptions claimed for certain systems of records. In addition, the Board is proposing to make minor editorial and technical changes to ensure that the Board's regulation is consistent with the Board's published systems of records and is clearer.

Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions
The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2011. The Regulation D amendments set the amount of total reservable liabilities of each depository institution that is subject to a zero percent reserve requirement in 2011 at $10.7 million, unchanged from its level in 2010. This amount is known as the reserve requirement exemption amount. The Regulation D amendments also set the amount of net transaction accounts at each depository institution that is subject to a three percent reserve requirement in 2011 at $58.8 million, up from $55.2 million in 2010. This amount is known as the low reserve tranche. The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act. The Board is also announcing changes in two other amounts, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency at which depository institutions must submit deposit reports.

TILA Section 129E establishes new requirements for appraisal independence for consumer credit transactions secured by the consumer's principal dwelling. The amendments are designed to ensure that real estate appraisals used to support creditors' underwriting decisions are based on the appraiser's independent professional judgment, free of any influence or pressure that may be exerted by parties that have an interest in the transaction. The amendments also seek to ensure that creditors and their agents pay customary and reasonable fees to appraisers. The Board seeks comment on all aspects of the interim final rule.

Effective July 21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amends the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) by increasing the threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions from $25,000 to $50,000. In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that, on or after December 31, 2011, this threshold must be adjusted annually by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers. Accordingly, the Board is proposing to make corresponding amendments to Regulation Z, which implements TILA, and to the accompanying staff commentary. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also increases the Consumer Leasing Act's threshold for exempt consumer leases from $25,000 to $50,000, the Board is proposing similar amendments to Regulation M elsewhere in today's Federal Register.

Community Reinvestment Act Regulations
The OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the OTS (collectively, ``the agencies'') are adopting revisions to our rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The agencies are revising the term ``community development'' to include loans, investments, and services by financial institutions that support, enable, or facilitate projects or activities that meet the ``eligible uses'' criteria described in Section 2301(c) of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), as amended, and are conducted in designated target areas identified in plans approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP). The final rule provides favorable CRA consideration of such activities that, pursuant to the requirements of the program, benefit low-, moderate-, and middle-income individuals and geographies in NSP target areas designated as ``areas of greatest need.'' Covered activities are considered both within an institution's assessment area(s) and outside of its assessment area(s), as long as the institution has adequately addressed the community development needs of its assessment area(s). Favorable consideration under the revised rule will be available until no later than two years after the last date appropriated funds for the program are required to be spent by the grantees. The agencies will provide reasonable advance notice to institutions in the Federal Register regarding termination of the rule once a date certain has been identified.

The Board is publishing a final rule amending the staff commentary that interprets the requirements of Regulation C (Home Mortgage Disclosure). The staff commentary is amended to increase the asset-size exemption threshold for depository institutions based on the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPIW). The adjustment from $39 million to $40 million reflects the increase of that index by 2.21 percent during the twelve-month period ending in November 2010. Thus, depository institutions with assets of $40 million or less as of December 31, 2010 are exempt from collecting data in 2011.

Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing
The Board is requesting public comment on proposed new Regulation II, Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing, which: establishes standards for determining whether an interchange fee received or charged by an issuer with respect to an electronic debit transaction is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction; and prohibits issuers and networks from restricting the number of networks over which an electronic debit transaction may be processed and from inhibiting the ability of a merchant to direct the routing of an electronic debit transaction to any network that may process such transactions. With respect to the interchange fee standards, the Board is requesting comment on two alternatives that would apply to covered issuers: an issuer-specific standard with a safe harbor and a cap; or a cap applicable to all such issuers. The proposed rule would additionally prohibit circumvention or evasion of the interchange fee limitations (under both alternatives) by preventing the issuer from receiving net compensation from the network (excluding interchange fees passed through the network). The Board also is requesting comment on possible frameworks for an adjustment to interchange fees for fraud-prevention costs. With respect to the debit-card routing rules, the Board is requesting comment on two alternative rules prohibiting network exclusivity: one alternative would require at least two unaffiliated networks per debit card, and the other would require at least two unaffiliated networks for each type of transaction authorization method. Under both alternatives, the issuers and networks would be prohibited from inhibiting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of an electronic debit transaction over any network that may process such transactions.

This interim rule revises the Board's interim rule published on September 24, 2010, which implemented certain requirements of the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008. The September 2010 interim rule requires creditors who extend consumer credit secured by real property or a dwelling to disclose summary information about interest rates and payment changes in a tabular format. The Board is issuing this interim rule to clarify certain provisions of the September 2010 interim rule. Specifically, this rule clarifies the requirements for adjustable-rate transactions that are ``5/1 ARM'' loans. It corrects the requirements for interest-only loans to clarify that the disclosures should reflect the date of the interest rate change rather than the date the first payment is due under the new rate. This interim rule also revises the definition of ``negative amortization loans'' to clarify which transactions are covered by the special disclosure requirements for such loans.

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are requesting comment on a proposal to revise their market risk capital rules to modify their scope to better capture positions for which the market risk capital rules are appropriate; reduce procyclicality in market risk capital requirements; enhance the rules' sensitivity to risks that are not adequately captured under the current regulatory measurement methodologies; and increase transparency through enhanced disclosures. The proposal does not include the methodologies adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for calculating the specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions due to their reliance on credit ratings, which is impermissible under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The proposal, therefore, retains the current specific risk treatment for these positions until the agencies develop alternative standards of creditworthiness as required by the Act. The proposed rules are substantively the same across the agencies.

The Board is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Regulation Y that establish the criteria for determining whether a company is ``predominantly engaged in financial activities'' and define the terms ``significant nonbank financial company'' and ``significant bank holding company'' for purposes of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'' or ``Act''). These terms are relevant to various provisions of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Act, including section 113, which authorizes the Financial Stability Oversight Council (``Council'') to designate a nonbank financial company for supervision by the Board if the Council determines that the company could pose a threat to the financial stability of the United States. The Council recently requested comment on a proposed rule to implement section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Board is adopting a final rule to implement the conformance period during which banking entities and nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board must bring their activities and investments into compliance with the prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading and relationships with hedge funds and private equity funds imposed by section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). Section 619 is commonly referred to as the ``Volcker Rule.'' The final rule is similar to the proposal issued for comment in November 2010. The Board, however, has incorporated a number of changes to the final rule to address issues raised by public commenters, to reduce potential regulatory burdens, and to clarify application of the rule.

Truth in Lending
The Board is publishing for public comment a proposed rule that would amend Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to implement certain amendments to the Truth in Lending Act made by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Regulation Z currently requires creditors to establish escrow accounts for higher-priced mortgage loans secured by a first lien on a dwelling. The proposal would implement statutory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act that lengthen the time for which a mandatory escrow account established for a higher-priced mortgage loan must be maintained. In addition, the proposal would implement the Act's disclosure requirements regarding escrow accounts. The proposal also would exempt certain loans from the statute's escrow requirement. The primary exemption would apply to mortgage loans extended by creditors that operate predominantly in rural or underserved areas, originate a limited number of mortgage loans, and do not maintain escrow accounts for any mortgage loans they service.

Equal Credit Opportunity
Section 701 of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) requires a creditor to notify a credit applicant when it has taken adverse action against the applicant. The ECOA adverse action requirements are implemented in the Board's Regulation B. Section 615(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) also requires a person to provide a notice when the person takes an adverse action against a consumer based in whole or in part on information in a consumer report. Certain model notices in Regulation B include the content required by both the ECOA and the FCRA adverse action provisions, so that creditors can use the model notices to comply with the adverse action requirements of both statutes. The Board proposes to amend these model notices in Regulation B to include the disclosure of credit scores and information relating to credit scores if a credit score is used in taking adverse action. These proposed amendments reflect the new content requirements in section 615(a) of the FCRA that were added by section 1100F of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Fair Credit Reporting Risk-Based Pricing Regulations
On January 15, 2010, the Board and the Commission published final rules to implement the risk-based pricing provisions in section 311 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The final rules generally require a creditor to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer when the creditor uses a consumer report to grant or extend credit to the consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that creditor. The Board and the Commission propose to amend their respective risk-based pricing rules to require disclosure of credit scores and information relating to credit scores in risk-based pricing notices if a credit score of the consumer is used in setting the material terms of credit. These proposed amendments reflect the new requirements in section 615(h) of the FCRA that were added by section 1100F of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks
The Board of Governors (Board) is proposing amendments to facilitate the banking industry's ongoing transition to fully- electronic interbank check collection and return, including proposed amendments to condition a depositary bank's right of expeditious return on the depositary bank agreeing to accept returned checks electronically either directly or indirectly from the paying bank. The Board also is proposing amendments to the funds availability schedule provisions to reflect the fact that there are no longer any nonlocal checks. The Board proposes to revise the model forms that banks may use in disclosing their funds-availability policies to their customers and to update the preemption determinations. Finally, the Board is requesting comment on whether it should consider future changes to the regulation to improve the check collection system, such as decreasing the time afforded to a paying bank to decide whether to pay a check in order to reduce the risk to a depositary bank of having to make funds available for withdrawal before learning whether a deposited check has been returned unpaid.

Accordingly, the Board is making corresponding amendments to Regulation M, which implements the CLA, and to the accompanying staff commentary. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also increases the Truth in Lending Act's threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions from $25,000 to $50,000, the Board is making similar amendments to Regulation Z elsewhere in today's Federal Register.

In addition, under section 806(e) of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Board is required to prescribe regulations setting forth the standards for determining when advance notice is required to be provided by a designated FMU for which the Board is the Supervisory Agency when the designated FMU proposes to change its rules, procedures, or operations that could materially affect the nature or level of risks presented by the designated FMU. The Board is proposing new Part 234 to Title 12 of the Code of Federal Regulations to implement these provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the Agencies by rule.

Regulation Z; Truth in Lending
The Board is publishing for public comment a proposed rule amending Regulation Z (Truth in Lending) to implement amendments to the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) made by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act). Regulation Z currently prohibits a creditor from making a higher-priced mortgage loan without regard to the consumer's ability to repay the loan. The proposal would implement statutory changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act that expand the scope of the ability-to-repay requirement to cover any consumer credit transaction secured by a dwelling (excluding an open- end credit plan, timeshare plan, reverse mortgage, or temporary loan). In addition, the proposal would establish standards for complying with the ability-to-repay requirement, including by making a ``qualified mortgage.'' The proposal also implements the Act's limits on prepayment penalties. Finally, the proposal would require creditors to retain evidence of compliance with this rule for three years after a loan is consummated. General rulemaking authority for TILA is scheduled to transfer to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) on July 21, 2011. Accordingly, this rulemaking will become a proposal of the CFPB and will not be finalized by the Board.

The Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA) sets forth rules for home-secured loans in which the total points and fees payable by the consumer at or before loan consummation exceed the greater of $400 or 8 percent of the total loan amount. In keeping with the statute, the Board has annually adjusted the $400 amount based on the annual percentage change reflected in the Consumer Price Index as reported on June 1. The adjusted dollar amount for 2012 is $611.

Capital Adequacy Guidelines; Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement: Treatment of Subordinated Securities Issued to the United States Treasury Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 and the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010
The Board is adopting a final rule that allows bank holding companies that have made a valid election to be taxed under Subchapter S of Chapter 1 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (S-Corp BHCs) and bank holding companies organized in mutual form (Mutual BHCs) to include the full amount of any subordinated debt securities issued to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (Treasury) under the capital purchase program (CPP), in tier 1 capital for purposes of the Board's risk-based and leverage capital guidelines for bank holding companies, provided that the Subordinated Securities will count toward the limit on the amount of other restricted core capital elements includable in tier 1 capital; and allows bank holding companies that are subject to the Board's Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (small bank holding companies) and that are S-Corp BHCs or Mutual BHCs to exclude the CPP Subordinated Securities from treatment as debt for purposes of the debt-to-equity standard under the Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement (Policy Statement). The Board is also adopting, and requesting comment on, an interim final rule that allows small bank holding companies that are S-Corps or Mutual BHCs to exclude from treatment as debt for purposes of the debt-to-equity standard under the Policy Statement subordinated debt securities issued to the Treasury through the Small Business Lending Fund established under the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010.

Regulation B; Equal Credit Opportunity
The Board is publishing for public comment a proposed rule amending Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity). Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA), as added by Section 1071 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act), requires that financial institutions collect and report information concerning credit applications made by women- or minority- owned businesses and by small businesses. ECOA Section 704B becomes effective on the date that rulemaking authority for ECOA is transferred to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which is July 21, 2011. Although the CFPB will have the authority to issue rules to implement ECOA Section 704B for most entities, the Board retains authority to issue rules for certain motor vehicle dealers. This proposed rule excepts motor vehicle dealers that are subject to the Board's jurisdiction from the requirements of ECOA Section 704B temporarily, until the effective date of final rules that will be issued by the Board to implement that provision.

Margin and Capital Requirements For Covered Swap Entities
On May 11, 2011, the OCC, Board, FDIC, FCA, and FHFA (collectively, the Agencies) published in the Federal Register a joint notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants for which one of the Agencies is the prudential regulator (the proposed rule). Due to the complexity of the rulemaking, to allow parties more time to consider the impact of the proposed rule, and so that the comment period on the proposed rule will run concurrently with the comment period for similar margin and capital requirements proposed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Agencies have determined that an extension of the comment period until July 11, 2011 is appropriate. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposed rules and prepare their comments.

Fair Credit Reporting Risk-Based Pricing Regulations
On January 15, 2010, the Board and the Commission published final rules to implement the risk-based pricing provisions in section 311 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act), which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The final rules generally require a creditor to provide a risk-based pricing notice to a consumer when the creditor uses a consumer report to grant or extend credit to the consumer on material terms that are materially less favorable than the most favorable terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers from or through that creditor. The Board and the Commission are amending their respective risk-based pricing rules to require disclosure of credit scores and information relating to credit scores in risk-based pricing notices if a credit score of the consumer is used in setting the material terms of credit. These final rules reflect the new requirements in section 615(h) of the FCRA that were added by section 1100F of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Equal Credit Opportunity
Section 701 of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) requires a creditor to notify a credit applicant when it has taken adverse action against the applicant. The ECOA adverse action requirements are implemented in the Board's Regulation B. Section 615(a) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) also requires a person to provide a notice when the person takes an adverse action against a consumer based in whole or in part on information in a consumer report. Certain model notices in Regulation B include the content required by both the ECOA and the FCRA adverse action provisions, so that creditors can use the model notices to comply with the adverse action requirements of both statutes. The Board is amending these model notices in Regulation B to include the disclosure of credit scores and related information if a credit score is used in taking adverse action. The revised model notices reflect the new content requirements in section 615(a) of the FCRA as amended by section 1100F of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

Regulation Z; Truth in Lending
The Board is publishing final revisions to the official staff commentary to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The commentary applies and interprets the requirements of Regulation Z. The Board is revising the commentary so that it accurately reflects the effective date of a final rule on loan originator compensation practices that was published in the Federal Register on September 24, 2010. At the time the final rule on loan originator compensation was issued, the Board intended it to become effective on April 1, 2011. However, on March 31, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit entered an administrative stay to temporarily delay implementation of the final rule. The administrative stay was in effect from April 1, 2011, until it was dissolved on April 5, 2011. Accordingly, the commentary is being revised to reflect that compliance with the final rule on loan originator compensation was not mandatory until April 6, 2011.

If an issuer meets these standards and wishes to receive the adjustment, it must certify its eligibility to receive the fraud-prevention adjustment to the payment card networks in which the issuer participates.

The proposed amendments would create a common two-week maintenance period for all depository institutions, create a penalty-free band around reserve balance requirements in place of carryover and routine penalty waivers, discontinue as-of adjustments related to deposit revisions, replace all other as-of adjustments with direct compensation, and eliminate the contractual clearing balance program. The proposed amendments are designed to reduce the administrative and operational costs associated with reserve requirements for both depository institutions and the Federal Reserve. The Board is requesting comment on all aspects of the proposal. In connection with the proposed elimination of the contractual clearing balance program, the Board is requesting comment on several issues related to the methodology used for the Private Sector Adjustment Factor that is part of the pricing of Federal Reserve Bank services.

Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions
The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2012. The Regulation D amendments set the amount of total reservable liabilities of each depository institution that is subject to a zero percent reserve requirement in 2012 at $11.5 million (up from $10.7 million in 2011). This amount is known as the reserve requirement exemption amount. The Regulation D amendments also set the amount of net transaction accounts at each depository institution that is subject to a three percent reserve requirement in 2012 at $71.0 million (up from $58.8 million in 2011). This amount is known as the low reserve tranche. The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act. The Board is also announcing changes in two other amounts, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency at which depository institutions must submit deposit reports.

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk; Alternatives to Credit Ratings for Debt and Securitization Positions
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on an amendment to the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to modify the agencies' market risk capital rules, published in the Federal Register on January 11, 2011 (January 2011 NPR). The January 2011 NPR did not include the methodologies adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) for calculating the standard specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions, because the BCBS methodologies generally rely on credit ratings. Under section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), all federal agencies must remove references to and requirements of reliance on credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness. In this NPR, the agencies are proposing to incorporate into the proposed market risk capital rules certain alternative methodologies for calculating specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions that do not rely on credit ratings. The agencies expect to finalize this proposal, together with the January 2011 NPR, in the coming months after receipt and consideration of comments.

Community Reinvestment Act Regulations
The OCC, the Board, and the FDIC (collectively, the ``agencies'') are amending their Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) regulations to adjust the asset-size thresholds used to define ``small bank'' or ``small savings association'' and ``intermediate small bank'' or ``intermediate small savings association.'' As required by the CRA regulations, the adjustment to the threshold amount is based on the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index.

Prohibitions and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Interests in, and Relationships With, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds
On November 7, 2011, the OCC, Board, FDIC, and SEC (collectively, the ``Agencies'') published in the Federal Register a joint notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment to implement section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') which contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company supervised by the Board to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (``proposed rule''). Due to the complexity of the issues involved and to facilitate coordination of the rulemaking among the responsible agencies as provided in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Agencies have determined that an extension of the comment period until February 13, 2012 is appropriate. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposed rules and prepare their comments.

Enhanced Prudential Standards and Early Remediation Requirements for Covered Companies
The Board is requesting comment on proposed rules that would implement the enhanced Prudential standards required to be established under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act) and the early remediation requirements established under section 166 of the Act. The enhanced standards include risk-based capital and leverage requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management (including establishing a risk committee), single-counterparty credit limits, stress test requirements, and a debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Financial Stability Oversight Council has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability.

On February 11, 2011, the Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking (``February 2011 NPR'') that would amend Regulation Y to establish the criteria for determining whether a company is ``predominantly engaged in financial activities'' and define the terms ``significant nonbank financial company'' and ``significant bank holding company'' for purposes of Title I of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'' or ``Act''). Based on comments received, the Board believes that clarification is needed regarding the scope of activities that would be considered to be financial activities under that proposal. Accordingly, this notice supplements the February 2011 NPR amending specific portions of the regulation for clarity.

The Board is amending Regulation J (Collection of Checks and Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks and Funds Transfers through Fedwire). The final rule eliminates references to ``as-of adjustments'' consistent with the Board's final amendments to Regulation D to simplify reserves administration; clarifies that an institution's Administrative Reserve Bank is deemed to have accepted deposit of a check or other item even if the institution sends the item directly to another Federal Reserve Bank; further clarifies that Regulation J continues to apply to a Fedwire funds transfer even if the funds transfer also meets the definition of ``remittance transfer'' under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act; and makes other conforming revisions.

The amendments are designed to reduce the administrative and operational costs associated with reserve requirements for depository institutions, the Board, and Federal Reserve Banks.

Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing
The Board has amended the provisions in Regulation II (Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing) that govern adjustments to debit card interchange transaction fees to make an allowance for fraud- prevention costs incurred by issuers. The amendments permit an issuer to receive or charge an amount of no more than 1 cent per transaction (the same amount currently permitted) in addition to its interchange transaction fee if the issuer develops and implements policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to take effective steps to reduce the occurrence of, and costs to all parties from, fraudulent electronic debit transactions. The amendments set forth fraud- prevention aspects that an issuer's policies and procedures must address and require an issuer to review its policies and procedures at least annually, and update them as necessary in light of their effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and changes in the types of fraud, methods used to commit fraud, and available fraud-prevention methods. An issuer must notify its payment card networks annually that it complies with the Board's fraud-prevention standards. Finally, the amendments provide that an issuer that is substantially noncompliant with the Board's fraud-prevention standards is ineligible to receive or charge a fraud-prevention adjustment and set forth a timeframe within which an issuer must stop receiving or charging a fraud-prevention adjustment.

The final rule does not include all of the methodologies adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for calculating the standardized specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions due to their reliance on credit ratings, which is impermissible under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. Instead, the final rule includes alternative methodologies for calculating standardized specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule; Market Risk Capital Rule
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on three notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) that would revise and replace the agencies' current capital rules. In this NPR (Advanced Approaches and Market Risk NPR) the agencies are proposing to revise the advanced approaches risk-based capital rule to incorporate certain aspects of ``Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems'' (Basel III) that the agencies would apply only to advanced approach banking organizations. This NPR also proposes other changes to the advanced approaches rule that the agencies believe are consistent with changes by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to its ``International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework'' (Basel II), as revised by the BCBS between 2006 and 2009, and recent consultative papers published by the BCBS. The agencies also propose to revise the advanced approaches risk- based capital rule to be consistent with Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). These revisions include replacing references to credit ratings with alternative standards of creditworthiness consistent with section 939A of the Dodd- Frank Act. Additionally, the OCC and FDIC are proposing that the market risk capital rule be applicable to federal and state savings associations, and the Board is proposing that the advanced approaches and market risk capital rules apply to top-tier savings and loan holding companies domiciled in the United States that meet the applicable thresholds. In addition, this NPR would codify the market risk rule consistent with the proposed codification of the other regulatory capital rules across the three proposals.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, and Prompt Corrective Action
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on three Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that would revise and replace the agencies' current capital rules. In this NPR, the agencies are proposing to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in ``Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems'' (Basel III). The proposed revisions would include implementation of a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement, a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, and, for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches capital rules, a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set of exposures in the denominator measure. Additionally, consistent with Basel III, the agencies are proposing to apply limits on a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk- based capital requirements. This NPR also would establish more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital. As discussed in the proposal, the revisions set forth in this NPR are consistent with section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which requires the agencies to establish minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements. In connection with the proposed changes to the agencies' capital rules in this NPR, the agencies are also seeking comment on the two related NPRs published elsewhere in today's Federal Register. The two related NPRs are discussed further in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Standardized Approach for Risk-Weighted Assets; Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on three notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) that would revise and replace the agencies' current capital rules. This NPR (Standardized Approach NPR) includes proposed changes to the agencies' general risk-based capital requirements for determining risk-weighted assets (that is, the calculation of the denominator of a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios). The proposed changes would revise and harmonize the agencies' rules for calculating risk- weighted assets to enhance risk-sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over recent years, including by incorporating certain international capital standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) set forth in the standardized approach of the ``International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework'' (Basel II), as revised by the BCBS between 2006 and 2009, and other proposals addressed in recent consultative papers of the BCBS. In this NPR, the agencies also propose alternatives to credit ratings for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain assets, consistent with section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). The revisions include methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets for residential mortgages, securitization exposures, and counterparty credit risk. The changes in the Standardized Approach NPR are proposed to take effect on January 1, 2015, with an option for early adoption. The Standardized Approach NPR also would introduce disclosure requirements that would apply to top-tier banking organizations domiciled in the United States with $50 billion or more in total assets, including disclosures related to regulatory capital instruments. In connection with the proposed changes to the agencies' capital rules in this NPR, the agencies are also seeking comment on the two related NPRs published elsewhere in today's Federal Register. The two related NPR's are discussed further in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

Annual Company-Run Stress Test Requirements for Banking Organizations With Total Consolidated Assets Over $10 Billion Other Than Covered Companies
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act) requires the Board to issue regulations that require financial companies with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion and for which the Board is the primary federal financial regulatory agency to conduct stress tests on an annual basis. The Board is adopting this final rule to implement the company-run stress test requirements in the Dodd-Frank Act regarding company-run stress tests for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion but less than $50 billion and state member banks and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets greater than $10 billion. This final rule does not apply to any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion. Furthermore, implementation of the stress testing requirements for bank holding companies, savings and loan holding companies, and state member banks with total consolidated assets of greater than $10 billion but less than $50 billion is delayed until September 2013.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or Act) requires the Board to conduct annual stress tests of bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) designates for supervision by the Board (nonbank covered companies, and together, with bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more, covered companies) and also requires the Board to issue regulations that require covered companies to conduct stress tests semi-annually. The Board is adopting this final rule to implement the stress test requirements for covered companies established in the Dodd-Frank Act. This final rule does not apply to any banking organization with total consolidated assets of less than $50 billion. Furthermore, implementation of the stress testing requirements for bank holding companies that did not participate in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program is delayed until September 2013.

Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions
The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2013. The Regulation D amendments set the amount of total reservable liabilities of each depository institution that is subject to a zero percent reserve requirement in 2013 at 12.4 million (from $11.5 million in 2012). This amount is known as the reserve requirement exemption amount. The Regulation D amendments also set the amount of net transaction accounts at each depository institution (over the reserve requirement exemption amount) that is subject to a three percent reserve requirement in 2013 at $79.5 million (from $71.0 million in 2012). This amount is known as the low reserve tranche. The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act. The Board is also announcing changes in two other amounts, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency at which depository institutions must submit deposit reports.

Consumer Leasing (Regulation M)
The Board and the Bureau are publishing final rules amending the official interpretations and commentary for the agencies' regulations that implement the Consumer Leasing Act (CLA). Effective July 21, 2011, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended the CLA by increasing the threshold for exempt consumer leases from $25,000 to $50,000 and requiring that, on or after December 31, 2011, this threshold be adjusted annually by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Accordingly, the exemption threshold was adjusted to $51,800 effective January 1, 2012. Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2012, the Board and the Bureau are adjusting the exemption threshold from $51,800 to $53,000, effective January 1, 2013. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Truth in Lending Act's threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions, the Board and the Bureau are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Truth in Lending Act elsewhere in the Federal Register.

Proposed Supervisory Guidance on Implementing Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Tests for Banking Organizations With Total Consolidated Assets of More Than $10 Billion But Less Than $50 Billion
The Board, FDIC and OCC, (collectively, the ``agencies'') are issuing this guidance, which outlines high-level principles for implementation of section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``DFA'') stress tests, applicable to all bank and savings-and-loan holding companies, national banks, state-member banks, state non-member banks, Federal savings associations, and state chartered savings associations with more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets (collectively, the ``$10-50 billion companies''). The guidance discusses supervisory expectations for DFA stress test practices and offers additional details about methodologies that should be employed by these companies. It also underscores the importance of stress testing as an ongoing risk management practice that supports a company's forward-looking assessment of its risks and better equips the company to address a range of macroeconomic and financial outcomes.

Appraisals for Higher-Priced Mortgage Loans-Supplemental Proposal
The Board, Bureau, FDIC, FHFA, NCUA, and OCC (collectively, the Agencies) are proposing to amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and the official interpretation to the regulation. This proposal relates to a final rule issued by the Agencies on January 18, 2013 (2013 Interagency Appraisals Final Rule or Final Rule), which goes into effect on January 18, 2014. The Final Rule implements a provision added to TILA by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd-Frank Act or Act) requiring appraisals for ``higher-risk mortgages.'' For certain mortgages with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate by a specified percentage, the Final Rule requires creditors to obtain an appraisal or appraisals meeting certain specified standards, provide applicants with a notification regarding the use of the appraisals, and give applicants a copy of the written appraisals used. The Agencies are proposing amendments to the Final Rule implementing these requirements; specifically, the Agencies are proposing exemptions from the rules for: transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not land; certain ``streamlined'' refinancings; and transactions of $25,000 or less.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Standards for Certain Bank Holding Companies and Their Subsidiary Insured Depository Institutions
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on a proposal that would strengthen the agencies' leverage ratio standards for large, interconnected U.S. banking organizations. The proposal would apply to any U.S. top-tier bank holding company (BHC) with at least $700 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $10 trillion in assets under custody (covered BHC) and any insured depository institution (IDI) subsidiary of these BHCs. In the revised capital approaches adopted by the agencies in July, 2013 (2013 revised capital approaches), the agencies established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent (supplementary leverage ratio), consistent with the minimum leverage ratio adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules. In this notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal or proposed rule), the agencies are proposing to establish a ``well capitalized'' threshold of 6 percent for the supplementary leverage ratio for any IDI that is a subsidiary of a covered BHC, under the agencies' prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. The Board also proposes to establish a new leverage buffer for covered BHCs above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent (leverage buffer). The leverage buffer would function like the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based capital ratios in the 2013 revised capital approaches. A covered BHC that maintains a leverage buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2 percent of its total leverage exposure would not be subject to limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The proposal would take effect beginning on January 1, 2018. The agencies seek comment on all aspects of this proposal.

Supervision and Regulation Assessments for Bank Holding Companies and Savings and Loan Holding Companies With Total Consolidated Assets of $50 Billion or More and Nonbank Financial Companies Supervised by the Federal Reserve
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is adopting a final rule to implement section 318 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Section 318 directs the Board to collect assessments, fees, or other charges equal to the total expenses the Board estimates are necessary or appropriate to carry out the supervisory and regulatory responsibilities of the Board for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more and nonbank financial companies designated for Board supervision by the Financial Stability Oversight Council.

Credit Risk Retention
The OCC, Board, FDIC, Commission, FHFA, and HUD (the agencies) are seeking comment on a joint proposed rule (the proposed rule, or the proposal) to revise the proposed rule the agencies published in the Federal Register on April 29, 2011, and to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15. U.S.C. 78o-11), as added by section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the agencies by rule.

Annual Company-Run Stress Tests at Banking Organizations With Total Consolidated Assets of More Than $10 Billion But Less Than $50 Billion; One-Year Transition Period to Revised Regulatory Capital Framework for 2013-2014 Stress Test Cycle
The Board invites comment on an interim final rule that provides a one-year transition period during which bank holding companies and most state member banks with more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets would not be required to reflect the revised regulatory capital framework that the Board approved on July 2, 2013 (revised capital framework) in their stress tests for the stress test cycle that begins October 1, 2013. For this stress test cycle, these companies will be required to estimate their pro forma capital levels and ratios over the full nine-quarter planning horizon using the Board's current regulatory capital rules. The interim final rule also clarifies when a banking organization would estimate its minimum regulatory capital ratios using the advanced approaches for a given stress test cycle.

The interim final rule also clarifies when a banking organization would estimate its minimum regulatory capital ratios using the advanced approaches for a given capital plan and stress test cycle and makes minor, technical changes to the capital plan rule.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, Prompt Corrective Action, Standardized Approach for Risk-weighted Assets, Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements, Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, and Market Risk Capital Rule
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), are adopting a final rule that revises their risk-based and leverage capital requirements for banking organizations. The final rule consolidates three separate notices of proposed rulemaking that the OCC, Board, and FDIC published in the Federal Register on August 30, 2012, with selected changes. The final rule implements a revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement, a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, and, for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules, a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set of exposures in the denominator. The final rule incorporates these new requirements into the agencies' prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. In addition, the final rule establishes limits on a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. Further, the final rule amends the methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets for all banking organizations, and introduces disclosure requirements that would apply to top-tier banking organizations domiciled in the United States with $50 billion or more in total assets. The final rule also adopts changes to the agencies' regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of section 171 and section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The final rule also codifies the agencies' regulatory capital rules, which have previously resided in various appendices to their respective regulations, into a harmonized integrated regulatory framework. In addition, the OCC is amending the market risk capital rule (market risk rule) to apply to Federal savings associations, and the Board is amending the advanced approaches and market risk rules to apply to top-tier savings and loan holding companies domiciled in the United States, except for certain savings and loan holding companies that are substantially engaged in insurance underwriting or commercial activities, as described in this preamble.

Loans in Areas Having Special Flood Hazards
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Farm Credit Administration (FCA), and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) (collectively, the Agencies) are proposing to amend their regulations regarding loans in areas having special flood hazards to implement provisions of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012. Specifically, the proposal would establish requirements with respect to the escrow of flood insurance payments, the acceptance of private flood insurance coverage, and the force-placement of flood insurance. The proposal also would clarify the Agencies' flood insurance regulations with respect to other amendments made by the Act and make technical corrections. Furthermore, the OCC and the FDIC are proposing to integrate their flood insurance regulations for national banks and Federal savings associations and for State non-member banks and State savings associations, respectively.

Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions
The Board is amending Regulation D, Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions, to reflect the annual indexing of the reserve requirement exemption amount and the low reserve tranche for 2014. The Regulation D amendments set the amount of total reservable liabilities of each depository institution that is subject to a zero percent reserve requirement in 2014 at $13.3 million (from $12.4 million in 2013). This amount is known as the reserve requirement exemption amount. The Regulation D amendments also set the amount of net transaction accounts at each depository institution (over the reserve requirement exemption amount) that is subject to a three percent reserve requirement in 2014 at $89.0 million (from $79.5 million in 2013). This amount is known as the low reserve tranche. The adjustments to both of these amounts are derived using statutory formulas specified in the Federal Reserve Act. The Board is also announcing changes in two other amounts, the nonexempt deposit cutoff level and the reduced reporting limit, that are used to determine the frequency at which depository institutions must submit deposit reports.

Truth in Lending (Regulation Z)
The Board and the Bureau are publishing final rules amending the official interpretations and commentary for the agencies' regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended TILA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions be adjusted annually by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2013, the Board and the Bureau are adjusting the exemption threshold to $53,500, effective January 1, 2014. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Consumer Leasing Act's threshold for exempt consumer leases, the Board and the Bureau are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Consumer Leasing Act elsewhere in the Federal Register.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio: Liquidity Risk Measurement, Standards, and Monitoring
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are requesting comment on a proposed rule (proposed rule) that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio standard established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The requirement is designed to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of internationally active banking organizations, thereby improving the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, as well as improvements in the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The proposed rule would apply to all internationally active banking organizations, generally, bank holding companies, certain savings and loan holding companies, and depository institutions with more than $250 billion in total assets or more than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure, and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The proposed rule would also apply to companies designated for supervision by the Board by the Financial Stability Oversight Council under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that do not have significant insurance operations and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The Board also is proposing on its own a modified liquidity coverage ratio standard that is based on a 21- calendar day stress scenario rather than a 30 calendar-day stress scenario for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies without significant insurance or commercial operations that, in each case, have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.

Collection of Checks and Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks and Funds Transfers through Fedwire; Time of Settlement by a Paying Bank for an Item Received from a Reserve Bank
The Board of Governors (Board) is requesting comment on proposed amendments to subpart A of its Regulation J, Collection of Checks and Other Items by Federal Reserve Banks and Funds Transfers through Fedwire. The proposed rule would permit the Federal Reserve Banks (Reserve Banks) to require paying banks that receive presentment of checks from the Reserve Banks to make the proceeds of settlement for those checks available to the Reserve Banks as soon as one half-hour after receipt of the checks. The proposed rule would also permit the Reserve Banks to obtain settlement from paying banks by as early as 8:30 a.m. Eastern time for checks that the Reserve Banks present. These proposed amendments to Regulation J are necessary to implement the proposed method for posting debits and credits to banks' Federal Reserve accounts to measure daylight overdrafts under the Federal Reserve Policy on Payment System Risk (PSR policy), as proposed in Docket No. OP-1472, elsewhere in the Federal Register.

The January 2013 Final Rule implements a provision added to TILA by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Dodd- Frank Act or Act) requiring appraisals for ``higher-risk mortgages.'' For certain mortgages with an annual percentage rate that exceeds the average prime offer rate by a specified percentage, the January 2013 Final Rule requires creditors to obtain an appraisal or appraisals meeting certain specified standards, provide applicants with a notification regarding the use of the appraisals, and give applicants a copy of the written appraisals used. On July 10, 2013, the Agencies proposed amendments to the January 2013 Final Rule implementing these requirements. Specifically, the Agencies proposed exemptions from the rules for transactions secured by existing manufactured homes and not land; certain streamlined refinancings; and transactions of $25,000 or less.

Treatment of Certain Collateralized Debt Obligations Backed Primarily by Trust Preferred Securities With Regard to Prohibitions and Restrictions on Certain Interests in, and Relationships With, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds
The OCC, Board, FDIC, CFTC and SEC (individually, an ``Agency,'' and collectively, ``the Agencies'') are each adopting a common interim final rule that would permit banking entities to retain investments in certain pooled investment vehicles that invested their offering proceeds primarily in certain securities issued by community banking organizations of the type grandfathered under section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd- Frank Act''). The interim final rule is a companion rule to the final rules adopted by the Agencies to implement section 13 of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (``BHC Act''), which was added by section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Prohibitions and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Interests in, and Relationships With, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds
The OCC, Board, FDIC, and SEC (individually, an ``Agency,'' and collectively, ``the Agencies'') are adopting a rule that would implement section 13 of the BHC Act, which was added by section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd- Frank Act''). Section 13 contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company supervised by the Board to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund.

Rules Regarding Availability of Information
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) published in the Federal Register of September 13, 2011, technical changes to the Board's rules regarding availability of information and other regulations that been made to account for the transfer of authority over Savings and Loans Holding Companies (SLHCs) to the Board. The publication inadvertently resulted in the omission of language in the Board's rules regarding availability of information. This document reinstates that language.

Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks
On March 25, 2011, the Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking (``2011 proposal'') intended to facilitate the banking industry's ongoing transition to fully electronic interbank check collection and return. Based on its analysis of the comments received in response to the 2011 proposal, the Board is revising its proposed amendments to subparts C and D of Regulation CC and is requesting comment on a revised proposed rule that would, among other things, encourage depositary banks to receive and paying banks to send returned checks electronically. The Board is requesting comment on two alternative frameworks for return requirements. Under Alternative 1, the expeditious-return requirement currently imposed on paying banks and returning banks for returned checks would be eliminated; a paying bank returning a check would be required to provide the depositary bank with a notice of nonpayment of the check--regardless of the amount of the check being returned--only if the paying bank sends the returned check in paper form. Under Alternative 2, the current expeditious- return requirement--using the current two-day test--would be retained for checks being returned to a depositary bank electronically via another bank, but the notice-of-nonpayment requirement would be eliminated. The Board is proposing to retain, without change, the regulation's current same-day settlement rule for paper checks. In addition, the Board is also requesting comment on applying Regulation CC's existing check warranties to checks that are collected electronically and on new warranties and indemnities related to checks collected electronically and to electronically-created items.

Privacy of Consumer Information (Regulation P)
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is proposing to repeal its Regulation P, 12 CFR Part 216, which was issued to implement section 504 of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act). Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) transferred rulemaking authority for a number of consumer financial protection laws from the Board, and six other Federal agencies, to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau), including rulemaking authority for the provisions in Subtitle A of Title V of the GLB Act that were implemented in the Board's Regulation P. In December 2011, the Bureau published an interim final rule establishing its own Regulation P to implement these provisions of the GLB Act (Bureau Interim Final Rule). The Bureau's Regulation P covers those entities previously subject to the Board's Regulation P. Accordingly, the Board is proposing to repeal its Regulation P.

Identity Theft Red Flags (Regulation V)
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is proposing to amend its Identity Theft Red Flags rule, which implements section 615(e) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The Red Flag Program Clarification Act of 2010 (Clarification Act) added a definition of ``creditor'' in FCRA section 615(e) that is specific to section 615(e). Accordingly, the proposed rule would amend the definition of ``creditor'' in the Identity Theft Red Flags rule to reflect the definition of that term as added by the statute. The proposed rule would also update a cross-reference in the Identity Theft Red Flags rule to reflect a statutory change in rulemaking authority.

Truth in Savings (Regulation DD)
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is proposing to repeal its Regulation DD, 12 CFR part 230, which was issued to implement the Truth in Saving Act (TISA). Title X of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) transferred rulemaking authority for a number of consumer financial protection laws, including TISA, from the Board to the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection (Bureau). In December 2011, the Bureau published an interim final rule establishing its own Regulation DD to implement TISA (Bureau Interim Final Rule).\1\ The Bureau Interim Final Rule substantially duplicates the Board's Regulation DD. Credit unions are not subject to either the Board's or Bureau's Regulation DD, and are covered instead by a substantially identical regulation issued by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 4311. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complementary Activities, Merchant Banking Activities, and Other Activities of Financial Holding Companies Related to Physical Commodities
On January 21, 2014, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) published in the Federal Register an advance notice of proposed rulemaking inviting public comment on various issues related to physical commodity activities conducted by financial holding companies and the restrictions imposed on these activities to ensure they are conducted in a safe and sound manner and consistent with applicable law. Due to the range and complexity of the issues addressed in the advance notice of proposed rulemaking, the Board has determined that an extension of the public comment period until April 16, 2014, is appropriate. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the notice and prepare their comments.

Application of the Revised Capital Framework to the Capital Plan and Stress Test Rules
The Board is adopting a final rule to require a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more to estimate its tier 1 common ratio using the exiting definition for purposes of the Board's capital plan and stress test rules; defer until October 1, 2015, the use of the Board's advanced approaches rule for purposes of the Board's capital planning and stress testing rules; maintain the one-year transition period in the current stress test cycle during which bank holding companies and most state member banks with more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets are not required to incorporate the Board's Basel III-based revised regulatory capital framework that the Board approved on July 2, 2013 (revised capital framework); and make minor, conforming changes to the Board's capital plan rule and stress test rules. The final rule maintains all the changes to the Board's capital plan rule and stress test rules that were required under two interim final rules that the Board issued in September 2013, except that under the final rule, no banking organization is required to use the advanced approaches rule for purposes of the capital planning and stress testing rules until 2015.

The Board, FDIC, and OCC, (collectively, the agencies) are issuing this guidance, which outlines principles for implementation of the stress tests required under section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act or DFA stress tests), applicable to all bank and savings and loan holding companies, national banks, state member banks, state nonmember banks, Federal savings associations, and state-chartered savings associations with more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets (collectively, the $10-50 billion companies). The guidance discusses supervisory expectations for DFA stress test practices and offers additional details about methodologies that should be employed by these companies.

Enhanced Prudential Standards for Bank Holding Companies and Foreign Banking Organizations
The Board is adopting amendments to Regulation YY to implement certain of the enhanced prudential standards required to be established under section 165 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act for bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $50 billion or more. The enhanced prudential standards include risk-based and leverage capital requirements, liquidity standards, requirements for overall risk management (including establishing a risk committee), stress-test requirements, and a 15-to-1 debt-to-equity limit for companies that the Financial Stability Oversight Council (Council) has determined pose a grave threat to financial stability. The amendments also establish risk-committee requirements and capital stress-testing requirements for certain bank holding companies and foreign banking organizations with total consolidated assets of $10 billion or more. The rule does not impose enhanced prudential standards on nonbank financial companies designated by the Council for supervision by the Board.

The proposed rule also implements the requirement in the Dodd- Frank Act for States to report to the Appraisal Subcommittee of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) the information required by the Appraisal Subcommittee (ASC) to administer the new national registry of appraisal management companies (AMC National Registry or Registry). In conjunction with this implementation, the FDIC is proposing to integrate its appraisal regulations for State nonmember banks and State savings associations.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, Proposed Revisions to the Definition of Eligible Guarantee
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed rule) that would revise the definition of eligible guarantee as incorporated into the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rule, adopted in the agencies' July 2013 regulatory capital rule (2013 capital rule). The agencies inadvertently limited the recognition of guarantees of wholesale exposures under the advanced approaches risk-based capital rule as incorporated into subpart E of the 2013 capital rule (advanced approaches). To address this matter, the proposed rule would remove the requirement that an eligible guarantee be made by an eligible guarantor for purposes of calculating the risk-weighted assets of an exposure (other than a securitization exposure) under the advanced approaches. The proposed change to the definition of eligible guarantee would apply to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies that are subject to the advanced approaches.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Standards for Certain Bank Holding Companies and Their Subsidiary Insured Depository Institutions
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are adopting a final rule that strengthens the agencies' supplementary leverage ratio standards for large, interconnected U.S. banking organizations (the final rule). The final rule applies to any U.S. top- tier bank holding company (BHC) with more than $700 billion in total consolidated assets or more than $10 trillion in assets under custody (covered BHC) and any insured depository institution (IDI) subsidiary of these BHCs (together, covered organizations). In the revised regulatory capital rule adopted by the agencies in July 2013 (2013 revised capital rule), the agencies established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent, consistent with the minimum leverage ratio adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for banking organizations subject to the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rules. The final rule establishes enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards for covered BHCs and their subsidiary IDIs. Under the final rule, an IDI that is a subsidiary of a covered BHC must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 6 percent to be well capitalized under the agencies' prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. The Board also is adopting in the final rule a supplementary leverage ratio buffer (leverage buffer) for covered BHCs of 2 percent above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent. The leverage buffer functions like the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based capital ratios in the 2013 revised capital rule. A covered BHC that maintains a leverage buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2 percent of its total leverage exposure is not subject to limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments under the final rule. Elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the agencies are proposing changes to the 2013 revised capital rule's supplementary leverage ratio, including changes to the definition of total leverage exposure, which would apply to all advanced approaches banking organizations and thus, if adopted, would affect banking organizations subject to this final rule.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Proposed Revisions to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed rule) that would revise the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio (total leverage exposure) that the agencies adopted in July 2013 as part of comprehensive revisions to the agencies' regulatory capital rules (2013 revised capital rule). Specifically, the proposed rule would revise the treatment of on- and off-balance sheet exposures for purposes of determining total leverage exposure, and more closely align the agencies' rules on the calculation of total leverage exposure with international leverage ratio standards. The proposed rule would incorporate in total leverage exposure the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and other similar instruments through which a banking organization provides credit protection (sold credit protection), modify the calculation of total leverage exposure for derivatives and repo-style transactions, and revise the credit conversion factors (CCFs) applied to certain off- balance sheet exposures. The proposed rule also would make changes to the methodology for calculating the supplementary leverage ratio and to the public disclosure requirements for the supplementary leverage ratio. The proposed rule would apply to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies (banking organizations) that are subject to the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rules (advanced approaches banking organizations), as defined in the 2013 revised capital rule, including advanced approaches banking organizations that are subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards that the agencies have adopted in final form and published elsewhere in today's Federal Register (the eSLR standards). Consistent with the 2013 revised capital rule, advanced approaches banking organizations will be required to disclose their supplementary leverage ratios beginning January 1, 2015, and will be required to comply with a minimum supplementary leverage ratio capital requirement of 3 percent and, as applicable, the eSLR standards beginning January 1, 2018. The agencies are seeking comment on all aspects of the proposed rule.

The Board invites comment on a proposed rule (Regulation XX) that would implement section 622 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Section 622, which adds a new section 14 to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, establishes a financial sector concentration limit that generally prohibits a financial company from merging or consolidating with, or acquiring, another company if the resulting company's liabilities upon consummation would exceed 10 percent of the aggregate liabilities of all financial companies as calculated under that section. In addition, the proposal would establish reporting requirements for certain financial companies that are necessary to implement section 622.

Regulatory Publication and Review Under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996
The OCC, Board, and FDIC (``we'' or ``Agencies'') are conducting a review of the regulations we have issued to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations for insured depository institutions. This review is required by section 2222 of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (``EGRPRA''). To facilitate this review, the Agencies have divided these regulations into 12 subject-matter categories and identified the regulations within each category. At regular intervals over the next two years, the Agencies will publish four Federal Register requests for comment. Each will address one or more categories. We will invite the public to identify the regulations in each category that they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome for insured depository institutions and their regulated holding companies. This is the first of the four Federal Register requests for comment. In it, we are seeking comment on the regulations in the following three categories: Applications and Reporting, Powers and Activities, and International Operations. We will address the remaining nine categories in the three subsequent requests for comment. To aid the public, we also are publishing a chart that sets forth the rules addressed in this document, as well as those that we will address in the remaining three.

The Board invites comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking that would amend the capital plan and stress test rules to modify, following a transition period, the start date of the capital plan and stress test cycles from October 1 of a calendar year to January 1 of the following calendar year. The proposed rule would make other changes to the rules, including amending the capital plan rule to limit a bank holding company's ability to make capital distributions to the extent that the bank holding company's actual capital issuances are less than the amount indicated in its capital plan under baseline conditions, measured on a quarterly basis. The proposed rule would clarify application of the capital plan rule to a bank holding company that is a subsidiary of a U.S. intermediate holding company of a foreign banking organization and the characteristics of a stressed scenario to be included in company run stress tests. The proposed rule also would revise the Board's Policy Statement on the Scenario Design Framework for Stress Testing and the Board's Regulation YY to reflect the revisions to the start date of the stress test cycle.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, Revisions to the Definition of Eligible Guarantee
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are adopting a final rule that revises the definition of eligible guarantee in the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rule, adopted in the agencies' July 2013 regulatory capital rule (2013 capital rule). The final rule removes the requirement that an eligible guarantee be made by an eligible guarantor for purposes of calculating the risk- weighted assets of an exposure (other than a securitization exposure) under the advanced approaches risk-based capital rule as incorporated into the 2013 capital rule (advanced approaches). The change to the definition of eligible guarantee applies to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies that are subject to the advanced approaches.

Unfair or Deceptive Acts or Practices (Regulation AA)
The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board) is proposing to repeal its Regulation AA, which was issued pursuant to its rule writing authority under section 18(f)(1) of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act or Act). Section 1092(2) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) repealed section 18(f)(1) of the FTC Act, thus eliminating the Board's rule writing authority under the Act.

Truth in Lending (Regulation Z)
The Board and the Bureau are publishing final rules amending the official interpretations and commentary for the agencies' regulations that implement the Truth in Lending Act (TILA). The Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended TILA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer credit transactions be adjusted annually by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2014, the Board and the Bureau are adjusting the exemption threshold to $54,600, effective January 1, 2015. Because the Dodd-Frank Act also requires similar adjustments in the Consumer Leasing Act's threshold for exempt consumer leases, the Board and the Bureau are making similar amendments to each of their respective regulations implementing the Consumer Leasing Act in a joint rulemaking published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register.

The Board and the Bureau are publishing final rules amending the official interpretations and commentary for the agencies' regulations that implement the Consumer Leasing Act (CLA). The Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act) amended the CLA by requiring that the dollar threshold for exempt consumer leases be adjusted annually by any annual percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Based on the annual percentage increase in the CPI-W as of June 1, 2014, the Board and the Bureau are adjusting the exemption threshold to $54,600, effective January 1, 2015.

Margin and Capital Requirements for Covered Swap Entities
The OCC, Board, FDIC, FCA, and FHFA (each an ``Agency'' and, collectively, the ``Agencies'') are seeking comment on a proposed joint rule to establish minimum margin and capital requirements for registered swap dealers, major swap participants, security-based swap dealers, and major security-based swap participants for which one of the Agencies is the prudential regulator. This proposed rule implements sections 731 and 764 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which require the Agencies to adopt rules jointly to establish capital requirements and initial and variation margin requirements for such entities and their counterparties on all non- cleared swaps and non-cleared security-based swaps in order to offset the greater risk to such entities and the financial system arising from the use of swaps and security-based swaps that are not cleared.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Revisions to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio
In May 2014, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) issued a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR or proposed rule) to revise the definition of the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio (total leverage exposure) that the agencies adopted in July 2013 as part of comprehensive revisions to the agencies' regulatory capital rules (2013 revised capital rule). The agencies are adopting the proposed rule as final (final rule) with certain revisions and clarifications based on comments received on the proposed rule. The final rule revises total leverage exposure as defined in the 2013 revised capital rule to include the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and other similar instruments through which a banking organization provides credit protection (sold credit protection); modifies the calculation of total leverage exposure for derivative and repo-style transactions; and revises the credit conversion factors applied to certain off-balance sheet exposures. The final rule also changes the frequency with which certain components of the supplementary leverage ratio are calculated and establishes the public disclosure requirements of certain items associated with the supplementary leverage ratio. The final rule applies to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies (banking organizations) that are subject to the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rules, as defined in the 2013 revised capital rule (advanced approaches banking organizations), including advanced approaches banking organizations that are subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards that the agencies finalized in May 2014 (eSLR standards). Consistent with the 2013 revised capital rule, advanced approaches banking organizations will be required to disclose their supplementary leverage ratios beginning January 1, 2015, and will be required to comply with a minimum supplementary leverage ratio capital requirement of 3 percent and, as applicable, the eSLR standards beginning January 1, 2018.
