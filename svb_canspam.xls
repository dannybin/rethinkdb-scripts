Notice of Intent To Request Public Comments
As part of its systematic review of all Federal Trade Commission rules and guides, the Commission gives notice that, during 2010, it intends to request public comments on the rules listed below (``Rules''). The Commission will request comments on, among other things, the economic impact of and the continuing need for the Rules; possible conflict between the Rules and state, local, or other federal laws or regulations; and the effect of any technological, economic, or other industry changes on the Rules. Further, the Commission gives notice that, based on its current ongoing review proceedings, it is postponing regulatory review for certain rules previously scheduled for 2010 review. In addition, the Commission announces that it is accelerating its review of the Labeling Requirements for Alternative Fuels and Alternative Fueled Vehicles Rule to 2010. No Commission determination on the need for, or the substance of, the Rules should be inferred from the notice of intent to publish requests for comments. Finally, the Commission announces a revised 10-year regulatory review schedule.

Rule Concerning Cooling-Off Period for Sales Made at Homes or at Certain Other Locations
The Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'' or ``Commission'') has completed its regulatory review of the Trade Regulation Rule Concerning Cooling-Off Period for Sales Made at Homes or at Certain Other Locations (``Cooling-Off Rule'' or ``Rule'') as part of the Commission's systematic review of all current Commission regulations and industry guides. The Rule makes it an unfair and deceptive act or practice for a seller engaged in a door-to-door sale of consumer goods or services, with a purchase price of $25 or more, to fail to provide the buyer with certain oral and written disclosures regarding the buyer's right to cancel the contract within three business days from the date of the sales transaction. Based on the comments received, the Commission has determined to retain the Rule. In addition, the Commission is soliciting public comment on a proposed increase in the $25 exclusionary limit identified in the Rule to account for inflation since the exclusionary limit was established.
