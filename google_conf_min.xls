State Cemetery Grants
This final rule amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) regulations governing grants to States to establish, expand, or improve State veterans' cemeteries. The final rule implements a statutory change effected by the Veterans Programs Enhancement Act of 1998, which changed the grant formula from a 50-50 Federal-State matching program to a program that authorizes up to 100 percent Federal funding of certain costs. Additionally, amendments to this rule are necessary to simplify the preapplication process and to establish a system of prioritizing grant applications. Finally, non-substantive changes are necessary for purposes of clarification.

Uniform Administrative Requirements for Grants and Agreements With Institutions of Higher Education, Hospitals, and Other Non-Profit Organizations (OMB Circular A-110)
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is relocating Circular A-110 to title 2 in the Code of Federal Regulations (2 CFR), subtitle A, chapter II, subchapter B, part 215 as part of an initiative to provide the public with a central location for Federal government policies on grants and other financial assistance and nonprocurement agreements. This document relates to the previous document in today's Federal Register which established 2 CFR as that central location. Consolidating the OMB guidance and co-locating the agency regulations provides a good foundation for streamlining and simplifying the policy framework for grants and agreements as part of the efforts to implement the Federal Financial Assistance Management Improvement Act of 1999 (Pub. L. 106-107).

International Banking
The FDIC is publishing for notice and comment proposed amendments to subpart J of part 303 on international banking and revisions to subpart A of part 347, relating to the international activities and investments of insured state nonmember banks, and subpart B of part 347, relating principally to insured and noninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks. The proposed amendments address the relocation of grandfathered insured branches. They also reorganize, clarify, and revise subparts A and B of part 347, and address various issues raised as part of the FDIC's ongoing effort under the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (12 U.S.C. 3311) to address regulatory burden issues. Included in the revisions affecting grandfathered insured branches are revisions to the FDIC's asset pledge requirement to establish a risk-based system and revision of the FDIC's asset maintenance requirement to calculate the asset maintenance percentage based on the daily third-party liabilities of the branch. In addition, the FDIC is proposing to strengthen FDIC's supervisory processes and make conforming amendments for other FDIC rules as part of the proposal. The FDIC is also requesting comments, as part of this document, on whether deposits in wholesale U.S. branches of foreign banks should be covered by deposit insurance and on the accounting rules contained in subpart C of part 347.

The proposal would also revise the official staff commentary to the regulation.

Proposed revisions to the regulation would address its coverage of electronic check conversion services and those providing the services. Among other things, persons, such as merchants and other payees, that make electronic check conversion services available to consumers would have to obtain a consumer's authorization for the electronic fund transfer. In addition, the regulation would be revised to provide that payroll card accounts established directly or indirectly by an employer on behalf of a consumer for the purpose of providing salary, wages, or other employee compensation on a recurring basis are accounts covered by Regulation E. Proposed commentary revisions would provide guidance on preauthorized transfers, additional electronic check conversion issues, error resolution, and other matters.

Criminal History Check: Assessment of Application Fee
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to reflect an administrative change in the method of calculating the agency's application fee for criminal history checks requested by licensees. The amendment establishes the application fee amount as the sum of the user fee charged by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for performing criminal history checks on fingerprint records and an NRC handling charge assessed to ensure full recovery of NRC's administrative costs related to fingerprint record processing. The resulting increase in the fee is quite small ($3.00). The amendment also provides for the NRC to publish its current criminal history check fee on the NRC public Web site. The NRC will continue to notify licensees directly (by e-mail) whenever the application fee is adjusted.

Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit
This final rule implements the provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishing and regulating the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. The new voluntary prescription drug benefit program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003 in section 101 of Title I of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173). Although this final rule specifies most of the requirements for implementing the new prescription drug program, readers should note that we are also issuing a closely related rule that concerns Medicare Advantage organizations, which, if they offer coordinated care plans, must offer at least one plan that combines medical coverage under Parts A and B with prescription drug coverage. Readers should also note that separate CMS guidance on many operational details appears or will soon appear on the CMS website, such as materials on formulary review criteria, risk plan and fallback plan solicitations, bid instructions, solvency standards and pricing tools, plan benefit packages. The addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare represents a landmark change to the Medicare program that will significantly improve the health care coverage available to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA specifies that the prescription drug benefit program will become available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006. Generally, coverage for the prescription drug benefit will be provided under private prescription drug plans (PDPs), which will offer only prescription drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA PDs), which will offer prescription drug coverage that is integrated with the health care coverage they provide to Medicare beneficiaries under Part C of Medicare. PDPs must offer a basic prescription drug benefit. MA-PDs must offer either a basic benefit or broader coverage for no additional cost. If this required level of coverage is offered, MA-PDs or PDPs, but not fallback PDPs may also offer supplemental benefits through enhanced alternative coverage for an additional premium. All organizations offering drug plans will have flexibility in the design of the prescription drug benefit. Consistent with the MMA, this final rule also provides for subsidy payments to sponsors of qualified retiree prescription drug plans to encourage retention of employer-sponsored benefits. We are implementing the drug benefit in a way that permits and encourages a range of options for Medicare beneficiaries to augment the standard Medicare coverage. These options include facilitating additional coverage through employer plans, MA-PD plans and high-option PDPs, and through charity organizations and State pharmaceutical assistance programs. See sections II.C, II.J, and II.P, and II.R of this preamble for further details on these issues. The proposed rule identified options and alternatives to the provisions we proposed and we strongly encouraged comments and ideas on our approach and on alternatives to help us design the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible in meeting the needs of Medicare beneficiaries.

The IFR establishes security procedures for aircraft operators and gateway airport operators, and security requirements relating to crewmembers, passengers, and armed security officers onboard aircraft operating into or out of DCA. Although this IFR is effective on August 18, 2005, an aircraft operator may not conduct operations into or out of DCA until it is determined by TSA to be in compliance with the security requirements set forth in this IFR.

The Federal Election Commission is amending its rules regarding contributions to the separate segregated fund (``SSF'') of a trade association by employee-stockholders and executive and administrative personnel of corporations that are members of the trade association (collectively, ``solicitable class employees''). The revised rules will no longer prohibit corporate members of a trade association from using a payroll deduction or check-off system for employee contributions to the trade association's SSF. Instead, these final rules will allow a corporate member of a trade association to provide incidental services to collect and forward contributions from its solicitable class employees to the SSF of the trade association, including use of a payroll deduction or check-off system, upon written request of the trade association. These final rules will also require any member corporation that provides incidental services for contributions to a trade association's SSF, as well as the corporation's subsidiaries, divisions, branches and affiliates, to provide the same services for contributions to the SSF of any labor organization that represents members working for the corporation, or the corporation's subsidiaries, divisions, branches or affiliates, upon written request of the labor organization and at a cost not to exceed actual expenses incurred.

National Practitioner Data Bank for Adverse Information on Physicians and Other Health Care Practitioners: Reporting on Adverse and Negative Actions
This proposed rule would revise existing regulations under sections 401-432 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, governing the National Practitioner Data Bank for Adverse Information on Physicians and Other Health Care Practitioners, to incorporate statutory requirements under section 1921 of the Social Security Act, as amended by section 5(b) of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, and as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990. The Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, along with certain additional provisions in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, was designed to protect program beneficiaries from unfit health care practitioners, and otherwise improve the anti-fraud provisions of the Medicare and State health care programs. Section 1921, the statutory authority upon which this regulatory action is based, requires each State to adopt a system of reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) certain adverse licensure actions taken against health care practitioners and health care entities licensed or otherwise authorized by a State (or a political subdivision thereof) to provide health care services. It also requires each State to report any negative actions or findings that a State licensing authority, peer review organization, or private accreditation entity has concluded against a health care practitioner or health care entity.

The PBGC is changing its regulations to require that premium declarations be filed electronically. The requirement becomes effective for plans with 500 or more participants for the prior plan year starting with filings for plan years beginning in 2006 that are made on or after July 1, 2006, and for smaller plans starting with filings for plan years beginning after 2006. Plans may apply for exemptions on a case-by-case basis. Filings may be submitted through the PBGC's on-line e-filing application (``My Plan Administration Account,'' or ``My PAAA''). My PAA has data entry and editing screens that can be used to create and submit a filing, and can also accept uploaded files containing filing information that has been prepared and formatted using private-sector software in accordance with the PBGC's published standards.

Management of Federal Agency Disbursements
The Financial Management Service (FMS) is publishing an interim final rule amending 31 CFR part 208 (part 208) to facilitate the delivery of Federal payments to victims of disasters and emergencies. Part 208 implements the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 3332, which generally requires that Federal payments be made by electronic funds transfer (EFT). Under 31 U.S.C. 3332, the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary) must ensure that any individual required to receive a Federal payment by EFT have access to an account at a financial institution at a reasonable cost and with certain consumer protections. This amendment implements 31 U.S.C. 3332 by providing that the Department of the Treasury may establish and administer accounts for disaster victims in order to allow for the delivery of Federal payments by EFT. We are proceeding with this amendment in the form of an interim final rule that is effective without delay.

Power Reactor Security Requirements
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend the current security regulations and add new security requirements pertaining to nuclear power reactors. Additionally, this rulemaking includes new security requirements for Category I strategic special nuclear material (SSNM) facilities for access to enhanced weapons and firearms background checks. The proposed rulemaking would: Make generically applicable security requirements imposed by Commission orders issued after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, based upon experience and insights gained by the Commission during implementation; fulfill certain provisions of the Energy Policy Act of 2005; add several new requirements that resulted from insights from implementation of the security orders, review of site security plans, and implementation of the enhanced baseline inspection program and force-on-force exercises; update the regulatory framework in preparation for receiving license applications for new reactors; and impose requirements to assess and manage site activities that can adversely affect safety and security. The proposed safety and security requirements would address, in part, a petition for rulemaking (PRM 50- 80) that requests the establishment of regulations governing proposed changes to facilities which could adversely affect the protection against radiological sabotage.

Adjustment of the Immigration and Naturalization Benefit Application and Petition Fee Schedule
This rule adjusts the fee schedule for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) immigration and naturalization benefit applications and petitions, including nonimmigrant applications and visa petitions. These fees fund the cost of processing applications and petitions for immigration benefits and services, and USCIS' associated operating costs. USCIS is revising these fees because the current fee schedule does not adequately reflect current USCIS processes or recover the full costs of services provided by USCIS. Without an immediate adjustment of the fee schedule, USCIS cannot provide adequate capacity to process all applications and petitions in a timely and efficient manner. In addition, the revised fees will eliminate USCIS' dependency on revenue from interim benefits, temporary programs, and premium processing fees. This rule also merges fees for certain applications and petitions so applicants and petitioners will only have to pay a single fee. In addition, the rule expands the classes of aliens that will be exempt from paying filing fees for certain immigration benefits, and modifies the criteria for waiving the filing fee due to an individual's inability to pay. Based on comments received by USCIS during the public comment period, this rule changes the fees for adjustment of status applications, and the fee waiver and exemption eligibility criteria for several immigration benefits. This final rule will provide sufficient funding for USCIS to meet national security, customer service, and processing time goals, and to sustain and improve service delivery.

Truth in Lending
The Board proposes to amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and the staff commentary to the regulation, following a comprehensive review of TILA's rules for open- end (revolving) credit that is not home-secured. The proposed revisions take into consideration comments from the public on an initial advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) published in December 2004 on a variety of issues relating to the format and content of open-end credit disclosures and the substantive protections provided under the regulation. The proposal also considers comments received on a second ANPR published in October 2005 that addressed several amendments to TILA's open-end credit rules contained in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. Consumer testing was conducted as a part of the review. Except as otherwise noted, the proposed changes apply solely to open-end credit. Disclosures accompanying credit card applications and solicitations would highlight fees and reasons penalty rates might be applied, such as for paying late. Creditors would be required to summarize key terms at account opening and when terms are changed. The proposal would identify specific fees that must be disclosed to consumers in writing before an account is opened, and give creditors flexibility regarding how and when to disclose other fees imposed as part of the open-end plan. Periodic statements would break out costs for interest and fees. Two alternatives are proposed dealing with the ``effective'' or ``historical'' annual percentage rate disclosed on periodic statements. Rules of general applicability such as the definition of open-end credit and dispute resolution procedures would apply to all open-end plans, including home-equity lines of credit. Rules regarding the disclosure of debt cancellation and debt suspension agreements would be revised for both closed-end and open-end credit transactions. Loans taken against employer-sponsored retirement plans would be exempt from TILA coverage.

Prohibition on Funding of Unlawful Internet Gambling
This notice is published jointly by the Departmental Offices of the Department of the Treasury (the ``Treasury'') and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ``Board'') (collectively, the ``Agencies'') and proposes rules to implement applicable provisions of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 (the ``Act''). In accordance with the requirements of the Act, the proposed rule designates certain payment systems that could be used in connection with unlawful Internet gambling transactions restricted by the Act. The proposed rule requires participants in designated payment systems to establish policies and procedures reasonably designed to identify and block or otherwise prevent or prohibit transactions in connection with unlawful Internet gambling. As required by the Act, the proposed rule also exempts certain participants in designated payment systems from the requirements to establish such policies and procedures because the Agencies believe it is not reasonably practical for those participants to identify and block, or otherwise prevent or prohibit, unlawful Internet gambling transactions restricted by the Act. Finally, the proposed rule describes the types of policies and procedures that non-exempt participants in each type of designated payment system may adopt in order to comply with the Act and includes non-exclusive examples of policies and procedures which would be deemed to be reasonably designed to prevent or prohibit unlawful Internet gambling transactions restricted by the Act. The proposed rule does not specify which gambling activities or transactions are legal or illegal because the Act itself defers to underlying State and Federal gambling laws in that regard and determinations under those laws may depend on the facts of specific activities or transactions (such as the location of the parties).

Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions; Issue and Cancellation of Federal Reserve Bank Capital Stock
The Board is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Regulation D (Reserve Requirements of Depository Institutions) and Regulation I (Issue and Cancellation of Federal Reserve Bank Capital Stock). Of these, only two are intended to represent substantive changes from existing law, while the remaining amendments are intended principally as clarifications. The first of the proposed substantive amendments would amend Regulation D to implement Section 603 of the Financial Services Regulatory Relief Act of 2006 by authorizing member banks of the Federal Reserve System to enter into pass-through arrangements. Previously, member banks were statutorily prohibited from passing required reserve balances through a correspondent institution. The second of the proposed substantive amendments would eliminate the provision in the ``savings deposit'' definition of Regulation D limiting certain kinds of transfers from savings deposits to not more than three per month. As a result, all kinds of transfers and withdrawals from a savings deposit that must be limited in number per month would be subject to the same numeric limitation of not more than six per month. The remaining proposed amendments, intended as clarifications, would reorganize the provisions relating to deposit reporting and the calculation and maintenance of required reserves, clarify the definitions of ``time deposit'' and ``vault cash,'' and make other minor editorial changes.

The Secretary of the Interior (Secretary) is promulgating final regulations providing that Indian tribes, at their discretion, may enter into business agreements and leases for energy resource development and grant rights-of-way for pipelines or electric transmission or distribution lines on tribal land without the Secretary's review and approval. Indian tribes entering into such business agreements, leases, and grants of rights-of-way must execute them under an approved tribal energy resource agreement (TERA) between the Secretary and the tribe. These final regulations provide the process under which a tribe may apply for, and the Secretary may grant, authority for an Indian tribe to review and approve leases and business agreements and grant rights-of-way for specific energy development activities on tribal lands through an approved TERA. The regulations also cover processes for implementation of TERAs, including periodic review and evaluation of a tribe's activities under a TERA, enforcement of TERA provisions, and administrative appeals. The regulations also include a process for a tribe's voluntarily rescinding a TERA.

Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery; Framework Adjustment 19
NMFS proposes regulations to approve and implement Framework Adjustment 19 (Framework 19) to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan (FMP) which was developed by the New England Fishery Management Council (Council). Framework 19 proposes the following management measures for the scallop fishery: Limited access scallop fishery specifications for 2008 and 2009 (open area days-at-sea (DAS) and Sea Scallop Access Area (access area) trip allocations); Elephant Trunk Access Area (ETAA) and Delmarva Access Area (Delmarva) in-season trip adjustment procedures; new Hudson Canyon Access Area (HCAA) measures; DAS allocation adjustments if an access area yellowtail flounder (yellowtail) total allowable catch (TAC) is caught; adjustments to the scallop overfishing definition; a prohibition on deckloading of scallops on access area trips; adjustments to the industry-funded observer program; a 30-day vessel monitoring system (VMS) power down provision; general category access area specifications for 2008 and 2009; and general category measures dependent on the implementation of Amendment 11 to the FMP as proposed by the Council, including a quarterly TAC, 2008 and 2009 general category quota allocations, and individual fishing quota (IFQ) permit cost recovery program requirements. NMFS will disapprove the Council's recommendation to eliminate the September 1 through October 31, ETAA seasonal closure, which was implemented under Framework 18 to the FMP to reduce sea turtle interactions with the scallop fishery. NMFS has determined that the Council's recommendation is not consistent with National Standard 2 of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (Magnuson-Stevens Act).

Truth in Lending
On June 14, 2007, the Board published proposed amendments to Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and to the staff commentary to the regulation, following a comprehensive review of TILA's rules for open-end (revolving) credit that is not home-secured. The proposed revisions addressed disclosures provided with credit card applications and solicitations, at account-opening, on periodic statements, when terms are changed on an account, and in advertisements. The Board is seeking comment on a limited number of additional revisions to the regulation and commentary. New proposed amendments address creditors' responsibilities to establish reasonable instructions for receiving timely payments and when a due date falls on a weekend or holiday. Creditors' responsibilities when investigating a claim of unauthorized transactions or an allegation of a billing error are also addressed. Advertisements for deferred interest plans would be required to provide additional information about how interest could be imposed. Comments submitted to the Board in response to the June 2007 proposed revisions remain under consideration by the Board and need not be submitted a second time.

NMFS is implementing measures included in Framework Adjustment 19 (Framework 19) to the Atlantic Sea Scallop Fishery Management Plan (FMP), which was developed by the New England Fishery Management Council (Council). Framework 19 was developed to achieve the following management measures for the scallop fishery: Limited access scallop fishery specifications for 2008 and 2009 (open area days-at-sea (DAS) and Sea Scallop Access Area (access area) trip allocations); Elephant Trunk Access Area (ETAA) and Delmarva Access Area (Delmarva) in-season trip adjustment procedures; new Hudson Canyon Access Area (HCAA) measures; DAS allocation adjustment measures if an access area yellowtail flounder (yellowtail) total allowable catch (TAC) is caught; adjustments to the scallop overfishing definition; a prohibition on deckloading of scallops on access area trips; adjustments to the industry-funded observer program; a 30-day vessel monitoring system (VMS) power down provision; general category access area specifications for 2008 and 2009; and general category measures dependent on the implementation of Amendment 11 to the FMP, including a quarterly TAC, 2008 and 2009 general category quota allocations, and individual fishing quota (IFQ) permit cost recovery program requirements.

Competitive and Noncompetitive Non-formula Grant Programs-General Grant Administrative Provisions and Program-Specific Administrative Provisions for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative
The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) is publishing one set of administrative requirements that contain elements common to all of the competitive and noncompetitive non-formula grant programs the Agency administers as an interim rule. Although this interim rule becomes effective on the date of publication, CSREES is requesting comments for a 60-day period as identified below. In a relatively short period of time, this will allow CSREES to apply basic rules to grant programs that are currently operating without them, including new non-formula grant programs created by the passage of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (FCEA) (Pub. L. 110-234) and to efficiently implement changes to programs with existing regulations as required by FCEA. The provisions in subparts A through E will serve as a single Agency resource codifying current practices simply and coherently for almost all CSREES competitive and noncompetitive non-formula grant programs except the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program. As specific rules are developed for each CSREES grant program, CSREES will propose adding a subpart for that Federal assistance program to this regulation. This interim rule is being published with a first set of program-specific grant regulations as subpart F for the Specialty Research Crop Initiative, authorized under section 7311 of FCEA.

Automated Clearing House (ACH) Debit Added as New Method of Payment for Express Mail Corporate Account Customers
This final rule revises Mailing Standards of the United States Postal Service, Domestic Mail Manual (DMM[supreg]), by making Automated Clearing House (ACH) debit a new method of payment for Express Mail[supreg] Corporate Account (EMCA) customers and eliminating the option to open new local trust accounts. The ACH system is a secure, private network that connects banks to one another by way of the Federal Reserve Board. This network enables electronic payments, such as ACH debits, to be handled and processed. EMCA customers will continue to have a total of three options to fund their accounts: Participate in the Centralized Account Processing System (CAPS); use a personal or business credit card; or authorize the USPS[supreg] to originate an ACH debit from a specified bank account. Existing EMCA customers that fund their account from a local trust account will still be required to maintain minimum balances. This final rule also revises the DMM by adding provisions to close an EMCA funded by ACH debit payments.

Energy Conservation Program: Energy Conservation Standards for Certain Consumer Products (Dishwashers, Dehumidifiers, Electric and Gas Kitchen Ranges and Ovens, and Microwave Ovens) and for Certain Commercial and Industrial Equipment (Commercial Clothes Washers)
The Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), as amended, prescribes energy conservation standards for various consumer products and commercial and industrial equipment, and requires the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to determine whether amended, more stringent, standards would be technologically feasible and economically justified, and would save a significant amount of energy. In this notice, DOE is proposing to amend the energy conservation standards for residential gas kitchen ranges and ovens and microwave ovens, as well as commercial clothes washers. DOE has tentatively determined that energy conservation standards for residential electric kitchen ranges and ovens are not technologically feasible or economically justified, and, therefore, is proposing a ``no-standard'' standard for these products. DOE had also initially considered amended energy conservation standards for residential dishwashers and dehumidifiers in this rulemaking; however, the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (EISA 2007) subsequently prescribed standards for these products. Therefore, DOE is not proposing standards for dishwashers and dehumidifiers in this notice, but will instead codify the statutory standards in a final rule. Finally, today's notice is announcing a public meeting on the proposed standards.

Truth in Lending
The Board is amending Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act (TILA), and the staff commentary to the regulation, following a comprehensive review of TILA's rules for open-end (revolving) credit that is not home-secured. Consumer testing was conducted as a part of the review. Except as otherwise noted, the changes apply solely to open-end credit. Disclosures accompanying credit card applications and solicitations must highlight fees and reasons penalty rates might be applied, such as for paying late. Creditors are required to summarize key terms at account opening and when terms are changed. Specific fees are identified that must be disclosed to consumers in writing before an account is opened, and creditors are given flexibility regarding how and when to disclose other fees imposed as part of the open-end plan. Costs for interest and fees are separately identified for the cycle and year to date. Creditors are required to give 45 days' advance notice prior to certain changes in terms and before the rate applicable to a consumer's account is increased as a penalty. Rules of general applicability such as the definition of open-end credit, dispute resolution procedures, and payment processing limitations apply to all open-end plans, including home-equity lines of credit. Rules regarding the disclosure of debt cancellation and debt suspension agreements are revised for both closed-end and open-end credit transactions. Loans taken against employer-sponsored retirement plans are exempt from TILA coverage.

Competitive and Noncompetitive Non-Formula Federal Assistance Programs-General Award Administrative Provisions and Program-Specific Administrative Provisions for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative
The Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES) is publishing as a final rule one set of administrative requirements that contain elements common to all of the competitive and noncompetitive non-formula Federal assistance programs the Agency administers. In a relatively short period of time, this allows CSREES to apply basic rules to Federal assistance programs that had been operating without them, including new non-formula Federal assistance programs created by the enactment of the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (FCEA) and to efficiently implement changes to programs with existing regulations as required by FCEA. The provisions in subparts A through E serve as a single Agency resource codifying current practices simply and coherently for almost all CSREES competitive and noncompetitive non-formula Federal assistance programs except the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program and the Veterinary Medicine Loan Repayment Program (VMLRP). As specific rules are developed for each CSREES Federal assistance program, CSREES will propose adding a subpart for that Federal assistance program to this regulation. This final rule is published with a first set of program- specific Federal assistance regulations as subpart F for the Specialty Crop Research Initiative, authorized under section 412 of the Agricultural Research, Extension, and Education Reform Act of 1998, as added by section 7311 of FCEA.

Interoperability Requirements, Standards, or Performance Specifications for Automated Toll Collection Systems
The FHWA is adding a new part to the Code of Federal Regulations, to add regulations specifying the interoperability requirements for automated toll collection systems for the facilities that are tolled under any of the tolling programs contained in section 1604 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU). Specifically, this rulemaking requires facilities operating with authority under section 1604 of SAFETEA-LU to use electronic toll collection (ETC) systems and to maximize their system's interoperability with other toll facilities. Although a nationwide interoperability standard has not yet been established, this rule seeks to accelerate progress toward achieving nationwide interoperability by requiring these facilities to upgrade their ETC systems to the national standards whenever adopted.

Truth in Lending
The Board proposes to amend Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act, and the staff commentary to the regulation in order to implement provisions of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 that are effective on February 22, 2010. This proposal would establish a number of new substantive and disclosure requirements to establish fair and transparent practices pertaining to open-end consumer credit plans, including credit card accounts. In particular, the proposed rule would limit the application of increased rates to existing credit card balances, require credit card issuers to consider a consumer's ability to make the required payments, establish special requirements for extensions of credit to consumers who are under the age of 21, and limit the assessment of fees for exceeding the credit limit on a credit card account.

CBP will continue to accept quarterly HMF payments or refund requests via mail. These changes are intended to provide the trade with expanded electronic payment/refund options and to modernize and enhance CBP's port use fee collection efforts. This document also clarifies the regulations to reflect that both HMF supplemental payments and refund requests must be accompanied by the requisite CBP Form 350 (HMF Amended Quarterly Summary Report) and CBP Form 349 (HMF Quarterly Summary Report).

This final rule revises existing regulations under sections 401 through 432 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, governing the National Practitioner Data Bank for Adverse Information on Physicians and Other Health Care Practitioners, to incorporate statutory requirements under section 1921 of the Social Security Act, as amended by section 5(b) of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987 (MMPPPA), and as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The MMPPPA, along with certain additional provisions in the OBRA, was designed to protect program beneficiaries from unfit health care practitioners, and otherwise improve the anti-fraud provisions of Medicare and State health care programs. Section 1921, the statutory authority upon which this regulatory action is based, requires each State to adopt a system of reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) certain adverse licensure actions taken against health care practitioners and health care entities licensed or otherwise authorized by a State (or a political subdivision thereof) to provide health care services. It also requires each State to report any negative actions or findings that a State licensing authority, peer review organization, or private accreditation entity has concluded against a health care practitioner or health care entity.

Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Program
The U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) proposes to amend its regulations governing small business contracting procedures. This Proposed Rule would amend part 127, that was promulgated in a Final Rule on October 1, 2008, and entitled ``The Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance Procedures,'' RIN 3245-AF40. This Proposed Rule would implement procedures authorized by the Small Business Act (Act) (Pub. L. 85-536, as amended) to help ensure a level playing field on which Women-Owned Small Businesses (WOSBs) can compete for Federal contracting opportunities. SBA proposes changes to part 127 that include eliminating the requirement for an agency-by-agency determination of discrimination, adopting both ``numbers'' and ``dollars'' measures of underrepresentation, and using the Fiscal Year 2006 Central Contractor Registration (CCR) database as the data source for determining eligible industries under the WOSB Program. This Proposed Rule thus identifies the eligible industries under the Program as those industries in which WOSBs are underrepresented or substantially underrepresented using either the numbers or the dollars approach. This Proposed Rule seeks to retain, for the most part, parts 121 and 134 of the Final Rule published on October 1, 2008, titled ``The Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance Procedures,'' RIN 3245-AF40; these portions of the rule govern various implementation procedures of the Program, as more fully discussed below. In addition, SBA is withdrawing its proposed rule entitled ``The Women-Owned Small Business Federal Contract Assistance Procedures,'' which was published on October 1, 2008, in the Federal Register together with a request for comments on two data sets used to determine the eligible industries under the WOSB Program.

Physical Protection of Byproduct Material
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is proposing to amend its regulations to establish security requirements for the use and transport of category 1 and category 2 quantities of radioactive material, which the NRC considers to be risk-significant and therefore to warrant additional protection. Category 1 and category 2 thresholds are based on those established in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources which NRC endorses. The objective of this proposed rule is to provide reasonable assurance of preventing the theft or diversion of category 1 and category 2 quantities of radioactive material. The proposed regulations would also include security requirements for the transportation of irradiated reactor fuel that weighs 100 grams or less in net weight of irradiated fuel. The proposed rule would affect any licensee that is authorized to possess category 1 or category 2 quantities of radioactive material, any licensee that transports these materials using ground transportation, and any licensee that transports small quantities of irradiated reactor fuel.

Management of Federal Agency Disbursements
Federal law requires that, unless waived by the Secretary of the Treasury (Secretary), all Federal payments, other than payments made under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, must be made electronically, that is, by electronic funds transfer (EFT). Direct deposit is the primary method that the Federal Government uses to make EFT payments. The Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Financial Management Service (FMS), is proposing to amend its regulation that describes the responsibilities of Federal agencies and recipients with respect to the electronic delivery of Federal payments and establishes the circumstances under which waivers from the EFT requirement are available. The proposed rule would generally require individuals to receive Federal nontax payments by EFT, effective March 1, 2011, except that there would be a delayed effective date to March 1, 2013, for two categories of individuals, namely: Individuals receiving Federal payments by check on March 1, 2011, and individuals whose claims for Federal benefits are filed before March 1, 2011, and who request check payments when they file. For Federal benefit recipients, this means that individuals whose claims for Federal benefits are filed on or after March 1, 2011, would receive their benefit payments by direct deposit. Individuals receiving their payments by direct deposit prior to March 1, 2011, would continue to do so. Individuals who do not choose direct deposit of their payments to an account at a financial institution would be enrolled in the Direct Express[supreg] Debit MasterCard[supreg] card program, a prepaid card program established pursuant to terms and conditions approved by FMS. Beginning on March 1, 2013, all recipients of Federal benefit and other non-tax payments would receive their payments by direct deposit, either to a bank account or to a Direct Express[supreg] card account.

Financial Crimes Enforcement Network; Amendment to the Bank Secrecy Act Regulations-Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access
FinCEN is proposing to revise the Bank Secrecy Act (``BSA'') regulations applicable to Money Services Businesses with regard to stored value or prepaid access. More specifically, the proposed changes include the following: renaming ``stored value'' as ``prepaid access'' and defining that term; deleting the terms ``issuer and redeemer'' of stored value; imposing suspicious activity reporting, customer information and transaction information recordkeeping requirements on both providers and sellers of prepaid access and, additionally, imposing a registration requirement on providers only; and exempting certain categories of prepaid access products and services posing lower risks of money laundering and terrorist financing from certain requirements. The proposed changes are intended to address regulatory gaps that have resulted from the proliferation of prepaid innovations over the last ten years and their increasing use as an accepted payment method. If these gaps are not addressed, there is increased potential for the use of prepaid access as a means for furthering money laundering, terrorist financing, and other illicit transactions through the financial system. This would significantly undermine many of the efforts previously taken by government and industry to safeguard the financial system through the application of BSA requirements to other areas of the financial sector. In this proposed rulemaking, we are reviewing the stored value/prepaid access regulatory framework with a focus on developing appropriate BSA regulatory oversight without impeding continued development of the industry, as well as improving the ability of FinCEN, other regulators and law enforcement to safeguard the U.S. financial system from the abuses of terrorist financing, money laundering, and other financial crime. In the course of our regulatory research into the operation of the prepaid industry, we have encountered a number of distinct issues, such as the appropriate obligations of payment networks and financial transparency at the borders, and we anticipate future rulemakings in these areas. We will seek to phase in any additional requirements, however, as the most prudent course of action for an evolving segment of the money services business (``MSB'') community.

Conforming Changes to Applicant Submission Requirements; Implementing Federal Financial Report and Central Contractor Registration Requirements
This interim rule revises HUD regulations to reference the new governmentwide Federal Financial Report (FFR), approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The purpose of the FFR is to consolidate requirements from the OMB issued Standard Forms SF-269, SF- 269A SF-272, and the SF-272A, into a single governmentwide form. The consolidation provides recipients of HUD grants and cooperative agreements a standard format for reporting the financial status of their grants and cooperative agreements and will assist in efforts to move to electronic grants management by reducing the variation and number of forms required for reporting. In including the new FFR in its regulations, HUD revises its regulations to remove references to SF-270 and SF-271, since they are no longer in use. This interim rule also codifies the requirement that applicants for HUD assistance possess an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR). Registration with CCR assists HUD in collecting, validating, and storing information in support of its grant programs and assists in ensuring the accuracy of data placed on the USASpending.gov website.

The Department of Labor proposes to amend the regulations governing the administration of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA), which provides benefits to all civilian Federal employees and certain other groups of employees and individuals who are injured or killed while performing their jobs. The Department of Labor also proposes to revise the regulations establishing the authority of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) which administers the FECA. The existing rules have been amended to acknowledge a change in the organization of the OWCP and amendments to the FECA which have occurred since the last time the regulations were amended in 1999. These changes also update the regulations by taking into account changes in technology and other changes to improve administrative efficiency. As many FECA claimants are not represented, the regulations are revised to insert FECA statutory references as a frame of reference for clarity and ease of use. The regulations include adding the skin as an organ pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8107(c)(22). The regulations also create a new special schedule covering injuries to non-citizen non-resident Federal employees outside the United States. Finally, the regulations covering the processing of medical bills have been updated to provide for greater use of technology in that process to reduce costs and to clarify requirements for such submissions.

Electronic Funds Transfer of Depository Taxes
This document contains temporary and final regulations relating to Federal tax deposits (FTDs) by Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT). In response to the decision of the Financial Management Service to discontinue the system that processes FTD coupons, the temporary and final regulations provide rules under which depositors must use EFT for all FTDs and eliminate the rules regarding FTD coupons. The temporary and final regulations affect all taxpayers that are required to make FTDs, in particular those taxpayers that currently use FTD coupons.

Conforming Changes to Applicant Submission Requirements; Implementing Federal Financial Report and Central Contractor Registration Requirements
This final rule follows publication of a July 15, 2010, interim rule that revised HUD regulations to reference the new governmentwide Federal Financial Report (FFR) approved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The FFR consolidates requirements from the OMB-issued Standard Forms SF-269, SF-269A, SF-272, and SF-272A into a single governmentwide form. In incorporating reference to the new FFR in its regulations, HUD amended its regulations to remove references to old and outdated forms that are no longer in use. The July 15, 2010, interim rule also codified the requirement that applicants for HUD assistance possess an active Central Contractor Registration (CCR). HUD is adopting the interim rule without change.

Management of Federal Agency Disbursements
The Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Financial Management Service (FMS), is amending its regulation to require recipients of Federal nontax payments to receive payment by electronic funds transfer (EFT), effective May 1, 2011. The effective date is delayed until March 1, 2013, for individuals receiving Federal payments by check on May 1, 2011; and for individuals who file claims for Federal benefits before May 1, 2011, and request check payments when they file. Individuals who do not choose direct deposit of their payments to an account at a financial institution would be enrolled in the Direct Express[supreg] Debit MasterCard[supreg] card program, a prepaid card program established pursuant to terms and conditions approved by FMS. Treasury waives the EFT requirement for recipients born prior to May 1, 1921, who are receiving payments by paper check on March 1, 2013; for payments not eligible for deposit to a Direct Express[supreg] prepaid card account; and for recipients whose Direct Express[supreg] card has been suspended or cancelled. In addition, this rule establishes the criteria under which a payment recipient may request a waiver if the EFT requirement creates a hardship due to his or her mental impairment or remote geographic location.

Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing
The Board is requesting public comment on proposed new Regulation II, Debit Card Interchange Fees and Routing, which: establishes standards for determining whether an interchange fee received or charged by an issuer with respect to an electronic debit transaction is reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer with respect to the transaction; and prohibits issuers and networks from restricting the number of networks over which an electronic debit transaction may be processed and from inhibiting the ability of a merchant to direct the routing of an electronic debit transaction to any network that may process such transactions. With respect to the interchange fee standards, the Board is requesting comment on two alternatives that would apply to covered issuers: an issuer-specific standard with a safe harbor and a cap; or a cap applicable to all such issuers. The proposed rule would additionally prohibit circumvention or evasion of the interchange fee limitations (under both alternatives) by preventing the issuer from receiving net compensation from the network (excluding interchange fees passed through the network). The Board also is requesting comment on possible frameworks for an adjustment to interchange fees for fraud-prevention costs. With respect to the debit-card routing rules, the Board is requesting comment on two alternative rules prohibiting network exclusivity: one alternative would require at least two unaffiliated networks per debit card, and the other would require at least two unaffiliated networks for each type of transaction authorization method. Under both alternatives, the issuers and networks would be prohibited from inhibiting a merchant's ability to direct the routing of an electronic debit transaction over any network that may process such transactions.

Enhanced Weapons, Firearms Background Checks, and Security Event Notifications
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC or the Commission) is proposing regulations that would implement its authority under the new section 161A of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, and revise existing regulations governing security event notifications. These proposed regulations are consistent with the provisions of the Firearms Guidelines the NRC published under section 161A with the approval of the U.S. Attorney General on September 11, 2009 (74 FR 46800). The NRC previously proposed new regulations on October 26, 2006 (71 FR 62663), that would have implemented this new authority as part of a larger proposed rule entitled ``Power Reactor Security Requirements.'' However, based upon changes to the final Firearms Guidelines the NRC is now proposing further revisions in these implementing regulations that address the voluntary application for enhanced weapons and the mandatory firearms background checks under section 161A. These implementing regulations would only apply to nuclear power reactor facilities and Category I strategic special nuclear material (SSNM) facilities. In addition, the NRC is also proposing revisions addressing security event notifications from different classes of facilities and the transportation of radioactive material consistently and would add new event notification requirements on the theft or loss of enhanced weapons.

Fees for Reviews of the Rule Enforcement Programs of Contract Markets and Registered Futures Associations
The Commission charges fees to designated contract markets and registered futures associations to recover the costs incurred by the Commission in the operation of its program of oversight of self- regulatory organization (SRO) rule enforcement programs (National Futures Association (NFA), a registered futures association, and the contract markets are referred to as SROs). The calculation of the fee amounts to be charged for FY 2010 is based upon an average of actual program costs incurred during FY 2007, 2008, and 2009, as explained below. The FY 2010 fee includes adjustments to program costs incurred in FY 2008 and 2009, which are being revised as a result of an internal review of program costs. The FY 2010 fee schedule and the revision of FY 2008 and 2009 fees are set forth in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section. Electronic payment of fees is required.

Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks
The Board of Governors (Board) is proposing amendments to facilitate the banking industry's ongoing transition to fully- electronic interbank check collection and return, including proposed amendments to condition a depositary bank's right of expeditious return on the depositary bank agreeing to accept returned checks electronically either directly or indirectly from the paying bank. The Board also is proposing amendments to the funds availability schedule provisions to reflect the fact that there are no longer any nonlocal checks. The Board proposes to revise the model forms that banks may use in disclosing their funds-availability policies to their customers and to update the preemption determinations. Finally, the Board is requesting comment on whether it should consider future changes to the regulation to improve the check collection system, such as decreasing the time afforded to a paying bank to decide whether to pay a check in order to reduce the risk to a depositary bank of having to make funds available for withdrawal before learning whether a deposited check has been returned unpaid.

Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act Provisions; Fisheries of the Northeastern United States; Annual Catch Limits and Accountability Measures
NMFS proposes to implement an Omnibus Amendment to all Mid- Atlantic Fishery Management Council (Council) fishery management plans (FMPs) in order to bring all Council FMPs into compliance with the requirements of the Magnuson-Stevens Act (MSA), as amended by the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA), which requires establishment of Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and Accountability Measures (AMs) for stocks not subject to the annual life cycle or other exemptions. There are multiple intended effects of the Omnibus Amendment: To establish a comprehensive framework for all Council FMPs that is compliant with the MSA requirements and consistent with the National Standard 1 guidelines issued by NMFS; to implement a process that more formally utilizes scientific recommendations in the establishment of annual catch levels; to establish a framework to derive ACLs with AM backstops from that scientific advice; and to establish processes for revisiting and modifying the measures that would be established by the respective FMP amendments so that overfishing is prevented, stocks are rebuilt as needed, and Optimum Yield (OY) may be achieved for all managed stocks under the Council's jurisdiction.

Performance of Functions; Claims for Compensation Under the Federal Employees' Compensation Act; Compensation for Disability and Death of Noncitizen Federal Employees Outside the United States
On August 13, 2010, the Department of Labor (DOL) proposed revisions to the regulations governing the administration of the Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA). The FECA provides benefits to all civilian Federal employees and certain other groups of employees and individuals who are injured or killed while performing their jobs. At that time, DOL also proposed revisions to the regulations establishing the authority of the Office of Workers' Compensation Programs (OWCP) which administers the FECA. The proposed changes were summarized in that publication. The existing rules have been amended to acknowledge a change in the organization of the OWCP and amendments to the FECA which have occurred since the last time the regulations were amended in 1999. These changes also update the regulations by taking into account changes in technology and other changes to improve administrative efficiency. As many FECA claimants are not represented, the regulations are revised to insert FECA statutory references as a frame of reference for clarity and ease of use. The regulations include adding the skin as an organ pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 8107(c)(22). The regulations also create a new special schedule covering injuries to non-citizen non-resident Federal employees outside the United States. Finally, the regulations covering the processing of medical bills have been updated to provide for greater use of technology in that process to reduce costs and to clarify requirements for such submissions.

Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Amendment 88
NMFS proposes regulations to implement Amendment 88 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (FMP), which regulates the Central Gulf of Alaska Rockfish Program. This proposed Rockfish Program would allocate exclusive harvest privileges to a specific group of license limitation program license holders who used trawl gear to target Pacific ocean perch, pelagic shelf rockfish, and northern rockfish during particular qualifying years. It would retain the conservation, management, safety, and economic gains realized under the Rockfish Pilot Program and resolve identified issues in the management and viability of the rockfish fisheries. This action is necessary to replace particular Rockfish Pilot Program regulations that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2011. This action is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the FMP, and other applicable law.

Immigration Benefits Business Transformation, Increment I
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is amending its regulations to enable U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) to migrate from a paper file-based, non-integrated systems environment to an electronic customer-focused, centralized case management environment for benefit processing. This transformation process will allow USCIS to streamline benefit processing, eliminate the capture and processing of redundant data, and reduce the number of and automate its forms. This transformation process will be a phased multi-year initiative to restructure USCIS business processes and related information technology systems. DHS is removing references to form numbers, form titles, expired regulatory provisions, and descriptions of internal procedures, many of which will change during transformation. DHS is also finalizing interim rules that permitted submission of benefit requests with an electronic signature when such requests are submitted in an electronic format rather than on a paper form and that removed references to filing locations for immigration benefits. In addition, in this rule DHS is publishing the final rule for six other interim rules published during the past several years, most of which received no public comments.

It sets forth the criteria to deliver outreach and technical assistance in a linguistically appropriate manner to socially disadvantaged farmers, ranchers and forest landowners to acquire, own, operate, and retain farms, ranches and non-industrial forest land. In addition, it assures farmers and ranchers who are members of socially disadvantaged groups equitable participation in the full range of agriculture programs offered by the Department.

Fisheries of the Exclusive Economic Zone Off Alaska; Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska; Amendment 88
NMFS issues regulations implementing Amendment 88 to the Fishery Management Plan for Groundfish of the Gulf of Alaska (GOA FMP). Amendment 88 is the Central Gulf of Alaska Rockfish Program (Rockfish Program). These regulations allocate exclusive harvest privileges to a specific group of license limitation program license holders who used trawl gear to target Pacific ocean perch, pelagic shelf rockfish, and northern rockfish during particular qualifying years. The Rockfish Program retains the conservation, management, safety, and economic gains realized under the Central Gulf of Alaska Rockfish Pilot Program (Pilot Program) and resolves identified issues in the management and viability of the rockfish fisheries. This action is necessary to replace particular Pilot Program regulations that are scheduled to expire at the end of 2011. This action is intended to promote the goals and objectives of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the GOA FMP, and other applicable law.

This proposed rule revises existing regulations under sections 401-432 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 and section 1921 of the Social Security Act, governing the National Practitioner Data Bank, to incorporate statutory requirements under section 6403 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act), Public Law 111-148. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also is removing Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 61, which implemented the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act, the statutory authority for this regulatory action, was designed to eliminate duplicative data reporting and access requirements between the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (established under section 1128E of the Social Security Act) and the National Practitioner Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to establish a transition period to transfer all data in the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank to the National Practitioner Data Bank, and, once completed, to cease operations of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Information previously collected and disclosed through the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank will then be collected and disclosed through the National Practitioner Data Bank. This regulatory action consolidates the collection and disclosure of information from both data banks into one part of the CFR.

The proposed revisions are intended to streamline the FTA environmental process for transit projects in response to the Presidential Memorandum on the subject ``Speeding Infrastructure Development through More Efficient and Effective Permitting and Environmental Review'' of August 31, 2011. The proposed categorical exclusions (CEs) would apply to FTA and improve the efficiency of the NEPA environmental reviews by making available the least intensive form of review for those actions that typically do not have the potential for significant environmental effects and therefore do not merit additional analysis and documentation associated with an Environmental Assessment or an Environmental Impact Statement.

Administrative Simplification: Adoption of a Standard for a Unique Health Plan Identifier; Addition to the National Provider Identifier Requirements; and a Change to the Compliance Date for ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Medical Data Code Sets
This proposed rule would implement section 1104 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (hereinafter referred to as the Affordable Care Act) by establishing new requirements for administrative transactions that would improve the utility of the existing Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) transactions and reduce administrative burden and costs.

This rule also proposes the adoption of a data element that will serve as an other entity identifier (OEID), an identifier for entities that are not health plans, health care providers, or ``individuals,'' that need to be identified in standard transactions.

In addition, the user fee decal program, certain administrative aspects of which had previously been managed by a private bank under a contract with CBP, is currently being administered entirely within CBP, and this document updates the addresses to which applicable forms and payments are to be mailed as a result of this change. Finally, this document amends the applicable regulations to provide for certain updated CBP form numbers, and to make nomenclature changes reflecting the transfer of CBP to the Department of Homeland Security. It should be noted that the amendments set forth in this document will not result in any change to the amount of the actual user fees.

Mortgage Servicing Rules Under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (Regulation X)
The Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection is amending Regulation X, which implements the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974, and implementing a commentary that sets forth an official interpretation to the regulation. The final rule implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act regarding mortgage loan servicing. Specifically, this final rule implements Dodd-Frank Act sections addressing servicers' obligations to correct errors asserted by mortgage loan borrowers; to provide certain information requested by such borrowers; and to provide protections to such borrowers in connection with force-placed insurance. Additionally, this final rule addresses servicers' obligations to establish reasonable policies and procedures to achieve certain delineated objectives; to provide information about mortgage loss mitigation options to delinquent borrowers; to establish policies and procedures for providing delinquent borrowers with continuity of contact with servicer personnel capable of performing certain functions; and to evaluate borrowers' applications for available loss mitigation options. Further, this final rule modifies and streamlines certain existing servicing-related provisions of Regulation X. For instance, this final rule revises provisions relating to mortgage servicers' obligation to provide disclosures to borrowers in connection with transfers of mortgage servicing, and mortgage servicers' obligation to manage escrow accounts, including restrictions on purchasing force-placed insurance for certain borrowers with escrow accounts and requirements to return amounts in an escrow account to a borrower upon payment in full of a mortgage loan. Concurrently with the issuance of this final rule, the Bureau is issuing a rule implementing amendments relating to mortgage servicing to the Truth in Lending Act in Regulation Z.

Physical Protection of Byproduct Material
The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) is amending its regulations to establish security requirements for the use and transport of category 1 and category 2 quantities of radioactive material. The NRC considers these quantities to be risk significant and, therefore, to warrant additional protection. Category 1 and category 2 thresholds are based on the quantities established by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in its Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of Radioactive Sources, which the NRC endorses. The objective of this final rule is to provide reasonable assurance of preventing the theft or diversion of category 1 and category 2 quantities of radioactive material. The regulations also include security requirements for the transportation of irradiated reactor fuel that weighs 100 grams or less in net weight of irradiated fuel. The final rule affects any licensee that possesses an aggregated category 1 or category 2 quantity of radioactive material, any licensee that transports these materials using ground transportation, and any licensee that transports small quantities of irradiated reactor fuel. The rule also considers a petition for rulemaking (PRM-71-13) submitted by the State of Washington that requested that the NRC adopt the use of global positioning satellite tracking as a national requirement for vehicles transporting highly radioactive mobile or portable radioactive devices.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also is removing regulations which implemented the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act, the statutory authority for this regulatory action, was designed to eliminate duplicative data reporting and access requirements between the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) (established under section 1128E of the Social Security Act) and the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). It requires the Secretary to establish a transition period to transfer all data in the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank to the National Practitioner Data Bank, and, once completed, to cease operations of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Information previously collected and disclosed to eligible parties through the HIPDB will then be collected and disclosed to eligible parties through the NPDB. This regulatory action consolidates the collection and disclosure of information from both data banks into one part of the CFR.

Therefore, the Bureau is interested in learning through responses to this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) about the debt collection system, about consumer experiences with the debt collection system, and about how rules for debt collectors might protect consumers without imposing unnecessary burdens on industry. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) was passed in 1977 and the Bureau is the first Federal agency to possess the authority to issue substantive rules for debt collection under this statute. The Bureau may also address concerns related to debt collection using its authority under the Dodd-Frank Act to issue regulations concerning unfair, deceptive, and abusive acts or practices and to establish disclosures to assist consumers in understanding the costs, benefits, and risks associated with consumer financial products and services.

Availability of Funds and Collection of Checks
On March 25, 2011, the Board published a notice of proposed rulemaking (``2011 proposal'') intended to facilitate the banking industry's ongoing transition to fully electronic interbank check collection and return. Based on its analysis of the comments received in response to the 2011 proposal, the Board is revising its proposed amendments to subparts C and D of Regulation CC and is requesting comment on a revised proposed rule that would, among other things, encourage depositary banks to receive and paying banks to send returned checks electronically. The Board is requesting comment on two alternative frameworks for return requirements. Under Alternative 1, the expeditious-return requirement currently imposed on paying banks and returning banks for returned checks would be eliminated; a paying bank returning a check would be required to provide the depositary bank with a notice of nonpayment of the check--regardless of the amount of the check being returned--only if the paying bank sends the returned check in paper form. Under Alternative 2, the current expeditious- return requirement--using the current two-day test--would be retained for checks being returned to a depositary bank electronically via another bank, but the notice-of-nonpayment requirement would be eliminated. The Board is proposing to retain, without change, the regulation's current same-day settlement rule for paper checks. In addition, the Board is also requesting comment on applying Regulation CC's existing check warranties to checks that are collected electronically and on new warranties and indemnities related to checks collected electronically and to electronically-created items.

Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) Program, State Reporting On Policies and Practices to Prevent Use of TANF Funds in Electronic Benefit Transfer Transactions in Specified Locations
The Administration for Children and Families (ACF) proposes to amend the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) regulations to require states, subject to penalty, to maintain policies and practices that prevent TANF funded assistance from being used in any electronic benefit transfer transaction in specified locations. This responds to provisions in the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 requiring states receiving TANF grants to maintain policies and practices as necessary to prevent assistance provided under the program from being used in any electronic benefit transfer transaction in any liquor store; any casino, gambling casino, or gaming establishment; or any retail establishment that provides adult-oriented entertainment in which performers disrobe or perform in an unclothed state for entertainment.

MMAA104000; Timing Requirements for the Submission of a Site Assessment Plan (SAP) or General Activities Plan (GAP) for a Renewable Energy Project on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS)
This rule amends the timing requirements for submitting a SAP or GAP. Under the rule, all OCS renewable energy leases and grants will have a preliminary term of 12 months in which a lessee or grantee must submit a SAP or a GAP. BOEM is taking this action because the current regulations provide timing requirements for submission of SAPs and GAPs that have proven to be impractical. In addition, this rule amends various other regulatory provisions, such as those pertaining to a lessee's first rent payment.

Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors
This document proposes regulations to implement Executive Order 13658, Establishing a Minimum Wage for Contractors, which was signed by President Barack Obama on February 12, 2014. Executive Order 13658 states that the Federal Government's procurement interests in economy and efficiency are promoted when the Federal Government contracts with sources that adequately compensate their workers. The Executive Order therefore seeks to increase efficiency and cost savings in the work performed by parties that contract with the Federal Government by raising the hourly minimum wage paid by those contractors to workers performing on covered Federal contracts to: $10.10 per hour, beginning January 1, 2015; and beginning January 1, 2016, and annually thereafter, an amount determined by the Secretary of Labor. The Executive Order directs the Secretary to issue regulations by October 1, 2014, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the requirements of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act to implement the Order's requirements. This proposed rule therefore establishes standards and procedures for implementing and enforcing the minimum wage protections of Executive Order 13658. As required by the Order and to the extent practicable, the proposed rule incorporates existing definitions, procedures, remedies, and enforcement processes under the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Service Contract Act, and the Davis-Bacon Act.

Mechanical and Digital Phonorecord Delivery Compulsory License
The United States Copyright Office is issuing a final rule to implement section 115 of the Copyright Act of 1976. Section 115 establishes a compulsory license for the making and distribution of phonorecords of nondramatic musical works. Section 115, in turn, requires the Register of Copyrights to prescribe by regulation the procedures for the monthly payment of royalties and preparation and service of monthly and annual statements of account by licensees. This final rule updates the existing payment and statement-of-account regulations in response to legal and marketplace developments, including the Copyright Royalty Board's adoption of newer percentage- of-revenue royalty rate structures for certain digital music services, and changes in accounting and industry practice in the years since the rules were last substantially amended.
