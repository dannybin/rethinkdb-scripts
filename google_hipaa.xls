HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Standard Unique Health Identifier for Health Care Providers
This final rule establishes the standard for a unique health identifier for health care providers for use in the health care system and announces the adoption of the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as that standard. It also establishes the implementation specifications for obtaining and using the standard unique health identifier for health care providers. The implementation specifications set the requirements that must be met by ``covered entities'': Health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers who transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which the Secretary has adopted a standard (known as ``covered health care providers''). Covered entities must use the identifier in connection with standard transactions. The use of the NPI will improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and other Federal health programs and private health programs, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care industry in general, by simplifying the administration of the health care system and enabling the efficient electronic transmission of certain health information. This final rule implements some of the requirements of the Administrative Simplification subtitle F of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates and Policy Changes
This rule proposes an update to the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The payment amounts and factors used to determine the proposed updated Federal rates that are described in this proposed rule have been determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related groups (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and will continue to be effective each October 1. The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005, would also be derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. In this proposed rule, we also are proposing to make clarifications to the existing policy regarding the designation of a satellite of a LTCH as an independent LTCH. In addition, we are proposing to expand the existing interrupted stay policy and proposing a change in the procedure for counting days in the average length of stay calculation for Medicare patients for hospitals qualifying as LTCHs.

Fair Credit Reporting Medical Information Regulations
The OCC, Board, FDIC, OTS, and NCUA (Agencies) are publishing for comment proposed regulations implementing section 411 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act). Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952. The FACT Act substantially amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA or Act), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. Section 411(a) of the FACT Act adds a new section 603(g)(1) to the FCRA to restrict the circumstances under which consumer reporting agencies may furnish consumer reports that contain medical information about consumers. Section 411(a) of the FACT Act also adds a new section 604(g)(2) to the FCRA to prohibit creditors from obtaining or using medical information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit. The Agencies are required to prescribe regulations that permit creditors to obtain or use medical information for eligibility purposes where necessary and appropriate to protect legitimate operational, transactional, risk, consumer, and other needs, consistent with the Congressional intent to restrict the use of medical information for inappropriate purposes. In addition, section 411(b) of the FACT Act adds a new section 603(d)(3) to the FCRA to restrict the sharing of medical information and related lists or descriptions with affiliates. Specifically, section 603(d)(3) provides that the standard exclusions from the definition of ``consumer report'' contained in section 603(d)(2)--such as sharing transaction or experience information about a consumer among affiliates or sharing other information among affiliates after providing the consumer notice and an opportunity to opt-out--do not apply if medical-related information is disclosed to an affiliate. Medical-related information includes medical information, an individualized list or description based on payment transactions for medical products or services, or an aggregate list of identified consumers based on payment transactions for medical products or services. The provisions of section 603(d)(3) do not apply if the sharing falls within certain exceptions, such as in connection with the business of insurance or annuities or for any purpose described in section 502(e) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act), Public Law 106- 102. Section 411(b) authorizes the Agencies to promulgate additional exceptions by regulation or order, as determined by the Agencies to be appropriate or necessary. The Agencies generally provide a 60-day period for the public to comment on the burdens associated with proposed rules. In this case, however, the Agencies believe that a 30-day comment period is appropriate because the statute was enacted in December 2003 and imposes a statutory deadline for the final rule of June 4, 2004.

Health Care Continuation Coverage
This document contains final rules implementing the notice requirements of the health care continuation coverage (COBRA) provisions of part 6 of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA or the Act). The continuation coverage provisions generally require group health plans to provide participants and beneficiaries who under certain circumstances would lose coverage (qualified beneficiaries) the opportunity to elect to continue coverage under the plan at group rates for a limited period of time. The final rules set minimum standards for the timing and content of the notices required under the continuation coverage provisions and establish standards for administering the notice process. These rules affect administrators of group health plans, participants and beneficiaries (including qualified beneficiaries) of group health plans, and the sponsors and fiduciaries of such plans. These rules also provide model notices for use by administrators of single-employer group health plans to satisfy their obligation to provide general notices and election notices.

These policy changes concern: supplemental survey data for practice expense; updated geographic practice cost indices for physician work and practice expense; updated malpractice RVUs; revised requirements for supervision of therapy assistants; revised payment rules for low osmolar contrast media; changes to payment policies for physicians and practitioners managing dialysis patients; clarification of care plan oversight requirements; revised requirements for supervision of diagnostic psychological testing services; clarifications to the policies affecting therapy services; revised requirements for assignment of Medicare claims; addition to the list of telehealth services; and, several coding issues. We are making these changes to ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. This final rule also addresses the following provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-17) (MMA): coverage of an initial preventive physical examination; coverage of cardiovascular (CV) screening blood tests; coverage of diabetes screening tests; incentive payment improvements for physicians in shortage areas; payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologicals; payment for renal dialysis services; coverage of routine costs associated with certain clinical trials of category A devices as defined by the Food and Drug Administration; hospice consultation service; indexing the Part B deductible to inflation; extension of coverage of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for the treatment in the home of primary immune deficiency diseases; revisions to reassignment provisions; and, payment for diagnostic mammograms, physicians' services associated with drug administration services and coverage of religious nonmedical health care institution items and services to the beneficiary's home. In addition, this rule updates the codes subject to the physician self-referral prohibition, discusses payment for set-up of portable x- ray equipment, discusses the third five-year refinement of work RVUs, and solicits comments on potentially misvalued work RVUs. We are also finalizing the calendar year (CY) 2004 interim RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised procedure codes for CY 2005. As required by the statute, we are announcing that the physician fee schedule update for CY 2005 is 1.5 percent, the initial estimate for the sustainable growth rate for CY 2005 is 4.3, and the conversion factor for CY 2005 is $37.8975.

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Inpatient Psychiatric Facilities
This final rule establishes a prospective payment system for Medicare payment of inpatient hospital services furnished in psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units of acute care hospitals and critical access hospitals. It implements section 124 of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999 (BBRA). The prospective payment system described in this final rule will replace the reasonable cost-based payment system under which psychiatric hospitals and psychiatric units are paid under Medicare.

Current Good Tissue Practice for Human Cell, Tissue, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Product Establishments; Inspection and Enforcement
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is requiring human cell, tissue, and cellular and tissue-based product (HCT/P) establishments to follow current good tissue practice (CGTP), which governs the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of HCT/Ps; recordkeeping; and the establishment of a quality program. The agency is also issuing new regulations pertaining to labeling, reporting, inspections, and enforcement that will apply to manufacturers of those HCT/Ps regulated solely under the authority of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), and not as drugs, devices, and/or biological products. The agency's actions are intended to improve protection of the public health while keeping regulatory burden to a minimum, which in turn would encourage significant innovation.

Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit
This final rule implements the provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishing and regulating the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. The new voluntary prescription drug benefit program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003 in section 101 of Title I of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173). Although this final rule specifies most of the requirements for implementing the new prescription drug program, readers should note that we are also issuing a closely related rule that concerns Medicare Advantage organizations, which, if they offer coordinated care plans, must offer at least one plan that combines medical coverage under Parts A and B with prescription drug coverage. Readers should also note that separate CMS guidance on many operational details appears or will soon appear on the CMS website, such as materials on formulary review criteria, risk plan and fallback plan solicitations, bid instructions, solvency standards and pricing tools, plan benefit packages. The addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare represents a landmark change to the Medicare program that will significantly improve the health care coverage available to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA specifies that the prescription drug benefit program will become available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006. Generally, coverage for the prescription drug benefit will be provided under private prescription drug plans (PDPs), which will offer only prescription drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA PDs), which will offer prescription drug coverage that is integrated with the health care coverage they provide to Medicare beneficiaries under Part C of Medicare. PDPs must offer a basic prescription drug benefit. MA-PDs must offer either a basic benefit or broader coverage for no additional cost. If this required level of coverage is offered, MA-PDs or PDPs, but not fallback PDPs may also offer supplemental benefits through enhanced alternative coverage for an additional premium. All organizations offering drug plans will have flexibility in the design of the prescription drug benefit. Consistent with the MMA, this final rule also provides for subsidy payments to sponsors of qualified retiree prescription drug plans to encourage retention of employer-sponsored benefits. We are implementing the drug benefit in a way that permits and encourages a range of options for Medicare beneficiaries to augment the standard Medicare coverage. These options include facilitating additional coverage through employer plans, MA-PD plans and high-option PDPs, and through charity organizations and State pharmaceutical assistance programs. See sections II.C, II.J, and II.P, and II.R of this preamble for further details on these issues. The proposed rule identified options and alternatives to the provisions we proposed and we strongly encouraged comments and ideas on our approach and on alternatives to help us design the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible in meeting the needs of Medicare beneficiaries.

Medicare Program; Establishment of the Medicare Advantage Program
This final rule implements provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishing and regulating the Medicare Advantage (MA) program. The MA program was enacted in Title II of The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173) on December 8, 2003. The MA program replaces the Medicare+Choice (M+C) program established under Part C of title XVIII of the Act, while retaining most key features of the M+C program. The MA program attempts to broadly reform and expand the availability of private health plan options to Medicare beneficiaries. This final rule responds to public comments on a proposed rule published on August 3, 2004 (FR 69 46866). EFFECTIVE DATE: These regulations are effective March 22, 2005 except for the following changes which will become effective on January 1, 2006: amendment of Sec. 417.600(b); removal of Sec. 417.602 through Sec. 417.638; and amendments to Sec. 417.832(d); and Sec. 417.840.

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates, Policy Changes, and Clarification
This proposed rule would update the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The payment amounts and factors used to determine the updated Federal rates that are described in this proposed rule have been determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related group (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and would continue to be effective each October 1. The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 is also derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. We are proposing to adopt new labor market area definitions for the purpose of geographic classification and the wage index. We are also proposing policy changes and clarifications.

These changes are necessary to reflect the advances in dialysis technology and standard care practices since the requirements were last revised in their entirety in 1976.

Every 3 years, approvals would be renewed for transplant centers that continue to meet these requirements.

Medicare Program; Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2006 Rates
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth proposed rate-of-increase limits as well as proposed policy changes for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005, with one exception: The proposed changes relating to submittal of hospital wage data by a campus or campuses of a multicampus hospital system (that is, the proposed changes to Sec. 412.230(d)(2) of the regulations) would be effective upon publication of the final rule. Among the policy changes that we are proposing to make are changes relating to: the classification of cases to the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs); the long-term care (LTC)-DRGs and relative weights; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; rebasing and revision of the hospital market basket; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; policies governing postacute care transfers, payments to hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education, submission of hospital quality data, payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals, changes in the requirements for provider-based facilities; and changes in the requirements for critical access hospitals (CAHs).

The exceptions permit creditors to obtain or use medical information in connection with credit eligibility determinations where necessary and appropriate for legitimate purposes, consistent with the Congressional intent to restrict the use of medical information for inappropriate purposes. The interim final rules also create limited exceptions to permit affiliates to share medical information with each other without becoming consumer reporting agencies.

Medicare Program; Medicare Integrity Program, Fiscal Intermediary and Carrier Functions, and Conflict of Interest Requirements
This proposed rule would establish the Medicare Integrity Program (MIP) and implement program integrity activities that are funded from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. This proposed rule would set forth the definition of eligible entities; services to be procured; competitive requirements based on Federal acquisition regulations and exceptions (guidelines for automatic renewal); procedures for identification, evaluation, and resolution of conflicts of interest; and limitations on contractor liability. This proposed rule would bring certain sections of the Medicare regulations concerning fiscal intermediaries and carriers into conformity with the Social Security Act (the Act). The rule would distinguish between those functions that the statute requires to be included in agreements with fiscal intermediaries and those that may be included in the agreements. It would also provide that some or all of the functions may be included in carrier contracts. Currently all these functions are mandatory for carrier contracts.

We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. In addition, in the Addendum to this final rule, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital- related costs.

Medicaid Program and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement
This interim final rule sets forth the State requirements to provide information to us for purposes of estimating improper payments in Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), as required under the Improper Payments Information Act (IPIA) of 2002. The IPIA requires heads of Federal agencies to annually estimate and report to the Congress these estimates of improper payments for the programs they oversee and, submit a report on actions the agency is taking to reduce erroneous payments. We published a proposed rule on August 27, 2004 to propose that States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP and report the State-specific error rates to us for purposes of computing the improper payment estimates for these programs. After extensive analysis of the issues related to having States measure improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP, including public comments on the provisions in the proposed rule, we are revising our proposed approach. Our new approach incorporates commenters' suggestions to engage a Federal contractor by contracting with that entity to complete the data processing and medical reviews and calculate the State-specific error rates. Based on the States' error rates, the contractor also will calculate the improper payment estimates for these programs which will be reported by the Department of Health and Human Services as required by the IPIA. This interim final rule sets out the types of information that States would need to submit to allow CMS to conduct medical and data processing reviews on claims made in the fee-for-service (FFS) setting. CMS will address estimating improper payments for Medicaid managed care and eligibility and SCHIP FFS, managed care and eligibility at a later time. This rule responds to the public comments on the proposed rule, sets forth the requirements for States to assist us and the contractor to produce State-specific error rates in Medicaid and SCHIP which will be used as the basis for a national error rate, and outlines future plans for measuring eligibility, which may include greater State involvement than the level required for the medical and data processing reviews.

In addition, using our separate legal authority under section 1877(b)(4) of the Act, we are proposing two separate regulatory exceptions for electronic health records software and directly related training services. These exceptions are consistent with the President's goal of achieving widespread adoption of interoperable electronic health records for the purpose of improving the quality and efficiency of health care, while maintaining the levels of security and privacy that consumers expect.

This document sets forth the Agency's review of and response to comments on the proposal and any changes made in response to those comments. Congress enacted USERRA to protect the rights of persons who voluntarily or involuntarily leave employment positions to undertake military service. USERRA authorizes the Secretary of Labor (in consultation with the Secretary of Defense) to prescribe rules implementing the law as it applies to States, local governments, and private employers. VETS proposed rules under that authority in order to provide guidance to employers and employees concerning their rights and obligations under USERRA. The Agency invited written comments on these proposed rules, and any specific issues related to the proposal, from members of the public.

The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related group (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and would continue to be effective each October 1. The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, would also be derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. We are also proposing to make policy changes and clarifications.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Enforcement
The Secretary of Health and Human Services is adopting rules for the imposition of civil money penalties on entities that violate rules adopted by the Secretary to implement the Administrative Simplification provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, Public Law 104-191 (HIPAA). The final rule amends the existing rules relating to the investigation of noncompliance to make them apply to all of the HIPAA Administrative Simplification rules, rather than exclusively to the privacy standards. It also amends the existing rules relating to the process for imposition of civil money penalties. Among other matters, the final rule clarifies and elaborates upon the investigation process, bases for liability, determination of the penalty amount, grounds for waiver, conduct of the hearing, and the appeal process.

Medicare Program; Conditions for Payment of Power Mobility Devices, Including Power Wheelchairs and Power-Operated Vehicles
This final rule conforms our regulations to section 302(a)(2)(E)(iv) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003. This rule defines the term power mobility devices (PMDs) as power wheelchairs and power operated vehicles (POVs or scooters). It sets forth revised conditions for Medicare payment of PMDs and defines who may prescribe PMDs. This rule also requires a face-to-face examination of the beneficiary by the physician or treating practitioner, a written prescription, and receipt of pertinent parts of the medical record by the supplier within 45 days after the face-to-face examination that the durable medical equipment suppliers maintain in their records and make available to CMS or its agents upon request. Finally, this rule discusses CMS' policy on documentation that may be requested by CMS or its agents to support a Medicare claim for payment, as well as the elimination of the Certificate of Medical Necessity (CMN) for PMDs.

Medicare Program; Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2007 Rates
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement a number of changes made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171). In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth proposed rate-of-increase limits as well as proposed policy changes for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006. In this proposed rule, we discuss our proposals to refine the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system under the IPPS to better recognize severity of illness among patients--for FY 2007, we are proposing to use a hospital-specific relative value cost center weighting methodology to adjust DRG relative weights and in FY 2008 (if not earlier), to implement consolidated severity-adjusted DRGs or alternative severity adjustment methods. Among the other policy changes that we are proposing to make are changes related to: limited revisions of the reclassification of cases to DRGs; the long-term care (LTC)-DRGs and relative weights; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; payments to hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education; submission of hospital quality data; payments to sole community hospitals and Medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals; and provisions governing emergency services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). We are also inviting comments on a number of issues including performance-based hospital payments for services and health information technology, as well as how to improve data transparency for consumers.

Medicare Program; Competitive Acquisition for Certain Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) and Other Issues
This proposed rule would implement competitive bidding programs for certain covered items of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) throughout the United States in accordance with sections 1847(a) and (b) of the Social Security Act (the Act). These programs would change the way that Medicare pays for these items under Part B of the Medicare program by utilizing bids submitted by DMEPOS suppliers to establish applicable payment amounts. We would phase in these programs over several years. This proposed rule would also detail requirements for CMS approved accreditation organizations that will be applying quality standards for all DMEPOS suppliers, including DMEPOS suppliers that participate in the DMEPOS competitive bidding program. In addition, this rule proposes a new fee schedule for home dialysis supplies and equipment still paid on a reasonable charge basis. This proposed rule would also clarify our policy on the scope of the statutory eyeglass coverage exclusion. We are proposing to specify in regulations that the eyeglass exclusion encompasses all devices that use lenses to aid vision or provide magnification of images for impaired vision. Further, this proposed rule would implement a revised methodology for calculating fee schedule amounts for new DMEPOS items.

We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement a number of changes made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub.

These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006. In this final rule, we discuss public comments we received on our proposals to refine the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system under the IPPS to better recognize severity of illness among patients--to use a hospital-specific relative value (HSRV) cost center weighting methodology to adjust DRG relative weights; and to implement consolidated severity-adjusted DRGs or alternative severity adjustment methods. Among the other policy changes that we are making are those changes related to: limited revisions of the reclassification of cases to DRGs; the long-term care (LTC)-DRGs and relative weights; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; payments to hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education; submission of hospital quality data; payments to sole community hospitals and Medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals; and provisions governing emergency services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). We are responding to requested public comments on a number of other issues that include performance-based hospital payments for services and health information technology, as well as how to improve health data transparency for consumers. In addition, we are responding to public comments received on a proposed rule issued in the Federal Register on May 17, 2006 that proposed to revise the methodology for calculating the occupational mix adjustment to the wage index for the FY 2007 hospital inpatient prospective payment system by applying an adjustment to 100 percent of the wage index using new 2006 occupational mix survey data collected from hospitals.

This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system, and to implement certain related provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, and the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. The proposed rule describes proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. In addition, this proposed rule would revise the current list of procedures that are approved when furnished in a Medicare-approved ambulatory surgical center (ASC), which would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. Further, this proposed rule would revise the ASC facility payment system to implement provisions of the MMA and other applicable statutory requirements, and update the ASC payment rates. Changes to the ASC facility payment system and the payment rates would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. This proposed rule would revise the emergency medical screening requirements for critical access hospitals (CAHs). In addition, this proposed rule would support implementation of a restructuring of the contracting entities responsibilities and functions that support the adjudication of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims. This restructuring is directed by section 1874A of the Act, as added by section 911 of the MMA. The prior separate Medicare intermediary and Medicare carrier contracting authorities under Title XVIII of the Act have been replaced with the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority. This proposed rule would also continue to implement the requirements of the DRA that require that we expand the ``starter set'' of 10 quality measures that we used in FY 2005 and FY 2006 for the hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data for the Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program. We began to adopt expanded measures effective for payments beginning in FY 2007. We are proposing to add additional quality measures to the expanded set of measures for FY 2008 payment purposes. These measures include the HCAHPS[supreg] survey, as well as Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP, formerly Surgical Infection Prevention (SIP)), and Mortality quality measures.

Medicaid Program and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement
This interim final rule with comment period sets forth the State requirements to provide information to us for purposes of estimating improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) requires heads of Federal agencies to estimate and report to the Congress annually these estimates of improper payments for the programs they oversee, and submit a report on actions the agency is taking to reduce erroneous payments. This interim final rule with comment responds to the public comments on the October 5, 2005 interim final rule and sets forth State requirements for submitting claims and policies to the Federal contractor for purposes of conducting FFS and managed care reviews. This interim final rule also sets forth and invites further comments on the State requirements for conducting eligibility reviews and estimating payment error rates due to errors in eligibility determinations.

Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC): Miscellaneous Provisions
This final rule amends a number of existing provisions in the WIC Program regulations to address issues raised by WIC State agencies, other members of the WIC community, and the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO). This final rule also incorporates recent legislation and certain longstanding program policies and State agency practices into the regulations. Further, the final rule also streamlines certain requirements in the regulations. In particular, this rulemaking streamlines the Federal requirements for financial and participation reporting by State agencies, and clarifies the requirements pertaining to the confidentiality of WIC information in order to strengthen coordination with public organizations and private physicians. It also incorporates recent legislation which provided the WIC State agencies with the option to extend the certification period for breastfeeding women. Further, it incorporates longstanding program policies and State agency practices into the regulations regarding State agency responses to subpoenas and other court-ordered requests for confidential information. Other provisions in this final rule are designed to improve eligibility determinations, incorporating program policies and State agency practices that have been in effect for some time. These changes are intended to reinforce program policies and State agency practices that strengthen services to WIC participants, improve Program administration, and increase State agency flexibility in managing the Program. Many of these provisions are options the State agency may choose to implement in operating the program.

This final rule with comment period revises the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system, and to implement certain related provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 and the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. In this final rule with comment period, we describe changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes are applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. In addition, this final rule with comment period implements future CY 2009 required reporting on quality measures for hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. This final rule with comment period revises the current list of procedures that are covered when furnished in a Medicare-approved ambulatory surgical center (ASC), which are applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. This final rule with comment period revises the emergency medical screening requirements for critical access hospitals (CAHs). This final rule with comment period supports implementation of a restructuring of the contracting entities responsibilities and functions that support the adjudication of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims. This restructuring is directed by section 1874A of the Act, as added by section 911 of the MMA. The prior separate Medicare intermediary and Medicare carrier contracting authorities under Title XVIII of the Act have been replaced with the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority. This final rule continues to implement the requirements of the DRA that require that we expand the ``starter set'' of 10 quality measures that we used in FY 2005 and FY 2006 for the hospital inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data for the Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program. We began to adopt expanded measures effective for payments beginning in FY 2007. In this rule, we are finalizing additional quality measures for the expanded set of measures for FY 2008 payment purposes. These measures include the HCAHPS survey, as well as Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP, formerly Surgical Infection Prevention (SIP)), and Mortality quality measures.

Request for Information on the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
This notice requests comments related to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (the ``FMLA'' or the ``Act''). The Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, of the Department of Labor (the ``Department'') seeks information for its consideration and review of the Department's administration of the Act and implementing regulations. The Department held stakeholder meetings regarding the FMLA with more than 20 groups from December 2002-February 2003. Many of the subject matter areas in this request are derived from comments at those stakeholder meetings and also from (1) rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States and other federal courts over the past twelve years; (2) the Department's experience in administering the law; and (3) public input presented in numerous Congressional hearings and public comments filed with the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') in connection with three annual reports to Congress regarding the Costs and Benefits of Federal regulations in 2001, 2002, 2004. In addition, the Department has reviewed numerous source materials about issues associated with the FMLA. During this process, the Department has heard a variety of concerns expressed about the FMLA. Some of those concerns, however, are beyond the Department's statutory authority to address. Some are not. In this regard, the Department invites interested parties having knowledge of, or experience with, the FMLA to submit comments and welcomes any pertinent information that will provide a basis for ascertaining the effectiveness of the current implementing regulations and the Department's administration of the Act. The questions posed are not meant to be an exclusive list of issues for which the Department seeks commentary and information.

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals RY 2008: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates, and Policy Changes; and Proposed Hospital Direct and Indirect Graduate Medical Education Policy Changes
This proposed rule would update the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The proposed payment amounts and factors used to determine the updated Federal rates that are described in this proposed rule were determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related group (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and would continue to be effective each October 1. The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008, would also be derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. We are also proposing to make policy changes which include proposed revisions to the GME and IME policies. In addition, we are adding a technical amendment correcting the regulations text at Sec. 412.22.

Medicare Program; Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2008 Rates
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement certain provisions made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171), the Medicare Improvements and Extension Act under Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-432), and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (Pub. L. 109-417). In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth proposed rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits or that have a portion of a prospective payment system payment based on reasonable cost principles. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007. In this proposed rule, we discuss our proposals to further refine the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system under the IPPS to better recognize severity of illness among patients--for FY 2008, we are proposing to adopt a Medicare Severity DRG (MS-DRG) classification system for the IPPS. We are also proposing to use the structure of the proposed MS-DRG system for the LTCH prospective payment system (referred to as MS-LTC-DRGs) for FY 2008. Among the other policy changes that we are proposing to make are changes related to: Limited revisions of the reclassification of cases to proposed MS-DRGs, the proposed relative weights for the proposed MS- LTC-DRGs; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; payments to hospitals for the indirect costs of graduate medical education; submission of hospital quality data; provisions governing application of sanctions relating to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA); provisions governing disclosure of physician ownership in hospitals and patient safety measures; and provisions relating to services furnished to beneficiaries in custody of penal authorities.

The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) hereby issues this final rule establishing regulations required by section 506 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), (Pub. L. 108-173). Section 506 of the MMA amended section 1866 (a)(1) of the Social Security Act to add subparagraph (U) which requires hospitals that furnish inpatient hospital services payable under Medicare to participate in the contract health services program (CHS) of the Indian Health Service (IHS) operated by the IHS, Tribes, and Tribal organizations, and to participate in programs operated by urban Indian organizations that are funded by IHS (collectively referred to as I/T/Us) for any medical care purchased by those programs. Section 506 also requires such participation to be in accordance with the admission practices, payment methodology, and payment rates set forth in regulations established by the Secretary, including acceptance of no more than such payment rates as payment in full.

Medicare Program; Surety Bond Requirement for Suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)
Consistent with section 4312(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), this proposed rule implements section 1834(a)(16)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) by requiring all Medicare suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS) to furnish CMS with a surety bond. We believe that this requirement would limit the Medicare program risk to fraudulent DME suppliers; enhance the Medicare enrollment process to help ensure that only legitimate DME suppliers are enrolled or are allowed to remain enrolled in the Medicare program; ensure that the Medicare program recoups erroneous payments that result from fraudulent or abusive billing practices by allowing CMS or its designated contractor to seek payments from a Surety up to the penal sum; and help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive products and services that are considered reasonable and necessary from legitimate DME suppliers.

This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system. In this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. In addition, this proposed rule would update the revised Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system to implement certain related provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). In this proposed rule, we propose the applicable relative payment weights and amounts for services furnished in ASCs, specific HCPCS codes to which the final policies of the ASC payment system would apply, and other pertinent ratesetting information for the CY 2008 ASC payment system. These changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. In this proposed rule, we also are proposing changes to the policies relating to the necessary provider designations of critical access hospitals (CAHs) that are being recertified when a CAH enters into a new co-location arrangement with another hospital or CAH or when the CAH creates or acquires an off-campus location. Further, we are proposing changes to several of the current conditions of participation that hospitals must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs to require the completion and documentation in the medical record of medical histories and physical examinations of patients conducted after admission and prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services and for postanesthesia evaluations of patients before discharge or transfer from the postanesthesia recovery area.

Medicare Program; Proposed Standards for E-Prescribing Under Medicare Part D
This rule proposes the adoption of final uniform standards for an electronic prescription drug program as required by section 1860D- 4(e)(4)(D) of the Social Security Act (the Act). It also proposes the adoption of a standard identifier for providers and dispensers for use in e-prescribing transactions under sections 1860D-4(e)(3) and 1860D- 4(e)(4)(C)(ii), and section 1102 of the Social Security Act. The standards proposed under section 1860D-4(e)(4)(D) have been pilot tested and evaluated, and the findings indicate that the proposed standards meet the requirements for final standards that can be used for the Medicare Part D e-prescribing programs. The standards proposed in this rule, in addition to the foundation standards that were already adopted as final standards (see 70 FR 67568), represent an ongoing approach to adopting standards that are consistent with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) objectives of patient safety, quality of care, and efficiencies and cost saving in the delivery of care.

This proposed rule would provide requirements for an eligible entity to enter into a contract under the Medicaid integrity audit program. The proposed rule would also establish the contracting requirements for eligible entities.

This final rule with comment period revises the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system. We describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system.

Revisions to Procedures for the Departmental Appeals Board and Other Departmental Hearings
The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) proposes to amend Departmental regulations governing administrative review by the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) and certain other administrative review regulations to ensure that the final administrative decision of the Department reflects the considered opinion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary). Current regulations at 45 CFR Part 16 governing the review of grant disputes do not specifically require the DAB to follow published guidance issued by the Secretary or a Departmental component. The DAB decision is currently the final administrative decision of the Department on such disputes and currently there is no Secretarial review of this final decision. Similarly, the DAB currently provides the final agency review of the imposition of civil monetary penalties (CMPs) for which administrative appeal is available under 45 CFR Part 160, Subpart E, enforcement sanctions under 42 CFR Part 422 and 423, determinations subject to reconsideration and appeal under 42 CFR Part 498 and the imposition by the Inspector General of the Department (I.G.) or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of exclusions, CMPs and assessments subject to appeal under 42 CFR Part 1005. As in 45 CFR Part 16, the decisions of the DAB under these processes are considered the final agency action on matters, though they are not subject to Secretarial review. This proposed rule would amend DAB regulations to require that the DAB follow published guidance that is not inconsistent with applicable statutes and regulations and would permit the Secretary an opportunity to review DAB decisions to correct errors in the application of law, or deviations from published guidance, in such disputes. This proposed rule would make technical changes to the regulations at 45 CFR Part 16. This proposed rule would also amend hearing and appeal procedures at 45 CFR Part 160, Subpart E and at 42 CFR Parts 422, 423 and 498 to include a parallel statement regarding the treatment of published guidance. Similarly, this proposed rule would amend the procedures at 45 CFR Part 81 to provide a similar statement regarding the treatment of published guidance by hearing examiners and reviewing authorities. In addition, this proposed rule would amend the hearing and appeal procedures at 45 CFR Part 160, Subpart E and 42 CFR Parts 422, 423, 498 and 1005 to provide a parallel opportunity for Secretarial review of DAB decisions. Finally, this proposed rule would revise the procedures for Head Start grantee appeals by applying the current 60-day time limit for ``final decisions'' to the Board's decision.

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals RY 2009: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates, Policy Changes, and Clarifications
This proposed rule would update the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). In addition, we are proposing to consolidate the annual July 1 update for payment rates and the October 1 update for Medicare severity long-term care diagnosis related group (MS-LTC-DRG) weights to a single fiscal year (FY) update. In this proposed rule, we are also clarifying various policy issues. This proposed rule would also describe our evaluation of the possible one-time adjustment to the Federal payment rate.

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
The Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration/ Wage and Hour Division proposes to revise certain regulations implementing the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (``FMLA''), the law that provides eligible workers with important rights to job protection for absences due to the birth or adoption of a child or for a serious health condition of the worker or a qualifying family member. The proposed changes are based on the Department's experience of nearly fifteen years administering the law, two previous Department of Labor studies of the FMLA in 1996 and 2001, several U.S. Supreme Court and lower court rulings, and the public comments received in response to a Request for Information (``RFI'') published in the Federal Register in December 2006 requesting information about experiences with the FMLA and comments on the effectiveness of these regulations. The Department is also seeking public comment on issues to be addressed in final regulations regarding military family leave. Section 585(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008 amends the FMLA to provide leave to eligible employees of covered employers to care for injured servicemembers and because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a covered family member is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status in support of a contingency operation (collectively referred to herein as military family leave). The provisions of this amendment providing FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember became effective on January 28, 2008, when the law was enacted. The provisions of this amendment providing for FMLA leave due to a qualifying exigency arising out of a covered family member's active duty (or call to active duty) status are not effective until the Secretary of Labor issues regulations defining ``qualifying exigencies.'' Because of the need to issue regulations under the military family leave provisions of the amendment as soon as possible, the Department is including in this Notice a description of the relevant military family leave statutory provisions, a discussion of issues the Department has identified, and a series of questions seeking comment on subjects and issues that may be considered in the final regulations.

Patient Safety and Quality Improvement
This document proposes regulations to implement certain aspects of the Patient Safety and Quality Improvement Act of 2005 (Patient Safety Act). The proposed regulations establish a framework by which hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers may voluntarily report information to Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs), on a privileged and confidential basis, for analysis of patient safety events. The proposed regulations also outline the requirements that entities must meet to become PSOs and the processes for the Secretary to review and accept certifications and to list PSOs. In addition, the proposed regulation establishes the confidentiality protections for the information that is assembled and developed by providers and PSOs, termed ``patient safety work product'' by the Patient Safety Act, and the procedures for the imposition of civil money penalties for the knowing or reckless impermissible disclosure of patient safety work product.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy
The Secretary proposes to amend the regulations governing education records maintained by educational agencies and institutions under section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act, which is also known as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, as amended (FERPA). These proposed regulations are needed to implement amendments to FERPA contained in the USA Patriot Act and the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, to implement two U.S. Supreme Court decisions interpreting FERPA, and to make necessary changes identified as a result of the Department's experience administering FERPA and current regulations. These changes would clarify permissible disclosures to parents of eligible students and conditions that apply to disclosures in health and safety emergencies; clarify permissible disclosures of student identifiers as directory information; allow disclosures to contractors and other outside parties in connection with the outsourcing of institutional services and functions; revise the definitions of attendance, disclosure, education records, personally identifiable information, and other key terms; clarify permissible redisclosures by State and Federal officials; and update investigation and enforcement provisions.

Medicare Program; Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2009 Rates; Proposed Changes to Disclosure of Physician Ownership in Hospitals and Physician Self-Referral Rules; Proposed Collection of Information Regarding Financial Relationships Between Hospitals and Physicians
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement certain provisions made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the Medicare Improvements and Extension Act, Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, and the TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007. In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008. We also are setting forth the proposed update to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2008. Among the other policy decisions and changes that we are proposing to make are changes related to: Limited proposed revisions of the classification of cases to Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups (MS-DRGs), proposals to address charge compression issues in the calculation of MS-DRG relative weights, the proposed revisions to the classifications and relative weights for the Medicare severity long- term care diagnosis-related groups (MS-LTC-DRGs); applications for new medical services and technologies add-on payments; wage index reform changes and the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the proposed FY 2009 wage indices; submission of hospital quality data; proposed changes to the postacute care transfer policy relating to transfers to home for the furnishing of home health services; and proposed policy changes relating to the requirements for furnishing hospital emergency services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). In addition, we are proposing policy changes relating to disclosure to patients of physician ownership or investment interests in hospitals and soliciting public comments on a proposed collection of information regarding financial relationships between hospitals and physicians. We are also proposing changes or soliciting comments on issues relating to policies on physician self-referrals.

These regulations provide pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners with the ability to use modern technology for controlled substance prescriptions while maintaining the closed system of controls on controlled substances dispensing; additionally, the proposed regulations would reduce paperwork for DEA registrants who dispense or prescribe controlled substances and have the potential to reduce prescription forgery. The proposed regulations would also have the potential to reduce the number of prescription errors caused by illegible handwriting and misunderstood oral prescriptions. Moreover, they would help both pharmacies and hospitals to integrate prescription records into other medical records more directly, which would increase efficiency, and would reduce the amount of time patients spend waiting to have their prescriptions filled.

We are revising existing policies regarding the PPS within the authority granted under section 1886(j) of the Act.

Medicare Program; Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2009 Rates; Payments for Graduate Medical Education in Certain Emergency Situations; Changes to Disclosure of Physician Ownership in Hospitals and Physician Self-Referral Rules; Updates to the Long-Term Care Prospective Payment System; Updates to Certain IPPS-Excluded Hospitals; and Collection of Information Regarding Financial Relationships Between Hospitals
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement certain provisions made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the Medicare Improvements and Extension Act, Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007, and the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. In addition, in the Addendum to this final rule, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. These changes are generally applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008. We also are setting forth the update to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2008. In addition to the changes for hospitals paid under the IPPS, this document contains revisions to the patient classifications and relative weights used under the long-term care hospital prospective payment system (LTCH PPS). This document also contains policy changes relating to the requirements for furnishing hospital emergency services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). In this document, we are responding to public comments and finalizing the policies contained in two interim final rules relating to payments for Medicare graduate medical education to affiliated teaching hospitals in certain emergency situations. We are revising the regulatory requirements relating to disclosure to patients of physician ownership or investment interests in hospitals and responding to public comments on a collection of information regarding financial relationships between hospitals and physicians. In addition, we are responding to public comments on proposals made in two separate rulemakings related to policies on physician self-referrals and finalizing these policies.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Modification to Medical Data Code Set Standards To Adopt ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS
This proposed rule would modify two of the medical data code set standards adopted in the Transactions and Code Sets final rule published in the Federal Register. It would also implement certain provisions of the Administrative Simplification subtitle of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. Specifically, the proposed rule would modify the standard code sets for coding diagnoses and inpatient hospital procedures by concurrently adopting the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for diagnosis coding, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) for inpatient hospital procedure coding. These new codes would replace the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) Volumes 1 and 2, and the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (CM) Volume 3 for diagnosis and procedure codes, respectively.

Ensuring That Department of Health and Human Services Funds Do Not Support Coercive or Discriminatory Policies or Practices In Violation of Federal Law
The Department of Health and Human Services proposes to promulgate regulations to ensure that Department funds do not support morally coercive or discriminatory practices or policies in violation of federal law, pursuant to the Church Amendments (42 U.S.C. 300a-7), Public Health Service (PHS) Act Sec. 245 (42 U.S.C. 238n), and the Weldon Amendment (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Pub.

Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”)
The Commission adopts two final amendments to the TSR. The first is an amendment making explicit a prohibition in the TSR on telemarketing calls that deliver prerecorded messages without a consumer's express written agreement to receive such calls. This amendment also requires that all prerecorded telemarketing calls provide specified opt-out mechanisms so that consumers can opt out of future calls. The amendment is necessary because the reasonable consumer would consider prerecorded telemarketing messages to be coercive or abusive of such consumer's right to privacy. The second amendment modifies the method for measuring the maximum call abandonment rate prescribed by the TSR's call abandonment safe harbor. The new method will permit sellers and telemarketers to calculate call abandonment rates for a live calling campaign over a thirty-day period, or any part thereof. This amendment is necessary because the current ``per day'' standard effectively precludes the use of predictive dialers with small calling lists.

Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports for Trusts in Which a Labor Organization Is Interested, Form T-1
The Employment Standards Administration (ESA) Office of Labor- Management Standards (OLMS) of the Department of Labor publishes this final rule to establish a form to be used by labor organizations to file trust annual financial reports (Form T-1) and to provide appropriate instructions and revise relevant portions of 29 CFR Part 43 relating to such reports. On March 4, 2008, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth the Department's Form T-1 proposal. Under the proposal, certain labor organizations would file annual reports about certain trusts to which they contributed money or otherwise provided financial assistance or over which they exercised managerial control. This document sets forth the Department's review of and response to comments on the proposal. This final rule requires that a labor organization with total annual receipts of $250,000 or more file a Form T-1 for each trust of the type defined by section 3(l) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and that meets one of the two following filing triggers: The labor organization, alone or with other labor organizations, either: Appoints or selects a majority of the members of the trust's governing board; or makes contributions to the trust that exceed 50 percent of the trust's receipts during the trust's fiscal year. This final rule provides five exemptions to the Form T-1 filing requirements: A political action committee (PAC) fund, if publicly available reports on the PAC fund are filed with federal or state agencies; any political organization for which reports are filed with the IRS under section 527 of the IRS code; trusts required to file a Form 5500 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); federal employee health benefit plans that are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA); and any trust for which an independent audit has been conducted, in accordance with the standards set forth in this final rule. This final rule will apply prospectively.

The final regulations also address new military family leave entitlements included in amendments to the FMLA enacted as part of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008, which provide additional job-protected leave rights to eligible employees of covered employers who provide care for covered servicemembers with a serious injury or illness and because of qualifying exigencies arising out of the fact that a covered military member is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call or order to active duty in support of a contingency operation.

Amendment to the Universal Waste Rule: Addition of Pharmaceuticals
EPA is proposing to add hazardous pharmaceutical wastes to the Universal Waste Rule. The Universal Waste Rule, originally promulgated on May 11, 1995, modified the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act's hazardous waste regulations by establishing a set of streamlined requirements for the collection of certain widely dispersed hazardous wastes, called ``universal wastes.'' This proposed rule would facilitate better management of pharmaceutical wastes by streamlining the generator requirements and encouraging generators of hazardous pharmaceutical wastes to manage them under the provisions of the Universal Waste Rule, which ensures that these hazardous pharmaceutical wastes are properly disposed of and treated as hazardous wastes. In addition, this proposed rule would facilitate the implementation of pharmaceutical take-back programs by removing RCRA barriers in the collection of pharmaceutical wastes from health care and other such regulated facilities, as well as facilitate the collection of pharmaceutical wastes from households, including non-hazardous pharmaceutical wastes.

The Secretary amends our regulations implementing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which is section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act. These amendments are needed to implement a provision of the USA Patriot Act and the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, which added new exceptions permitting the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records without consent. The amendments also implement two U.S. Supreme Court decisions interpreting FERPA, and make necessary changes identified as a result of the Department's experience administering FERPA and the current regulations. These changes clarify permissible disclosures to parents of eligible students and conditions that apply to disclosures in health and safety emergencies; clarify permissible disclosures of student identifiers as directory information; allow disclosures to contractors and other outside parties in connection with the outsourcing of institutional services and functions; revise the definitions of attendance, disclosure, education records, personally identifiable information, and other key terms; clarify permissible redisclosures by State and Federal officials; and update investigation and enforcement provisions.

State Long-Term Care Partnership Program: Reporting Requirements for Insurers
This final rule sets forth reporting requirements for private insurers that issue qualified long-term care insurance policies in States participating in the State Long-Term Care Partnership Program established under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) (Pub. L. 109- 171). Section 6021 of the DRA requires that the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) specify a set of reporting requirements and collect data from insurers on qualified long-term care insurance policies issued under the program and the subsequent use of the benefits under these policies. Under a State Long-Term Care Partnership Program, an amount equal to the benefits received under the long-term care insurance policy is disregarded in determining the assets of an individual for purposes of Medicaid eligibility and estate recovery.

The HITECH Act (the Act) at section 13402 requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue interim final regulations within 180 days of enactment to require covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and their business associates to provide for notification in the case of breaches of unsecured protected health information. For purposes of these requirements, section 13402(h) of the Act defines ``unsecured protected health information'' to mean protected health information that is not secured through the use of a technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in guidance, and requires the Secretary to issue such guidance no later than 60 days after enactment and to specify within the technologies and methodologies that render protected health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. Through this document, HHS is issuing the required guidance and seeking public comment both on the guidance as well as the breach notification provisions of the Act generally to inform the future rulemaking and updates to the guidance.

For purposes of determining what information is ``unsecured protected health information,'' in this document HHS is also issuing an update to its guidance specifying the technologies and methodologies that render protected health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals.

Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is revising its regulations to provide practitioners with the option of writing prescriptions for controlled substances electronically. The regulations will also permit pharmacies to receive, dispense, and archive these electronic prescriptions. These regulations are in addition to, not a replacement of, the existing rules. The regulations provide pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners with the ability to use modern technology for controlled substance prescriptions while maintaining the closed system of controls on controlled substances dispensing; additionally, the regulations will reduce paperwork for DEA registrants who dispense controlled substances and have the potential to reduce prescription forgery. The regulations will also have the potential to reduce the number of prescription errors caused by illegible handwriting and misunderstood oral prescriptions. Moreover, they will help both pharmacies and hospitals to integrate prescription records into other medical records more directly, which may increase efficiency, and potentially reduce the amount of time patients spend waiting to have their prescriptions filled.

Section 1562 of PPACA also added section 715 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and section 9815 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the Code).

We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare acute care hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2010. We also are setting forth the proposed update to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2010. We are proposing to update the payment policy and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). In the Addendum to this proposed rule, we also set forth the proposed changes to the payment rates, factors, and other payment rate policies under the LTCH PPS. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2010. We are proposing changes affecting the Medicare conditions of participation for hospitals relating to the types of practitioners who may provide rehabilitation services and respiratory care services. We are proposing changes affecting the determination of the effective date of provider agreements and supplier approvals under Medicare. Finally, we are proposing to offer psychiatric hospitals, hospitals with inpatient psychiatric programs, and psychiatric facilities that are not hospitals increased flexibility in obtaining accreditation to participate in the Medicaid program. Psychiatric hospitals would have the choice of meeting the existing regulatory requirements to participate in Medicare as a psychiatric hospital or to obtaining accreditation from a national accrediting organization whose psychiatric hospital accrediting program has been approved by CMS. Hospitals with inpatient psychiatric programs would have the choice of meeting the existing regulatory requirements for participation in Medicare as a hospital or obtaining accreditation from a national accrediting organization whose hospital accreditation program has been approved by CMS. In addition, psychiatric facilities that are not hospitals would be afforded the flexibility in obtaining accreditation by a national accrediting organization whose program has been approved by CMS, or by any other accrediting organization with comparable standards that is recognized by the State.

This interim final rule with comment period (IFC) implements the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, which was established by section 1102 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act). The Congress appropriated funding of $5 billion for the temporary program. Section 1102(a)(1) requires the Secretary to establish this temporary program not later than 90 days after enactment of the statute, which is June 21, 2010. The program ends no later than January 1, 2014. The program provides reimbursement to participating employment-based plans for a portion of the cost of health benefits for early retirees and their spouses, surviving spouses and dependents. The Secretary will reimburse plans for certain claims between $15,000 and $90,000 (with those amounts being indexed for plan years starting on or after October 1, 2011). The purpose of the reimbursement is to make health benefits more affordable for plan participants and sponsors so that health benefits are accessible to more Americans than they would otherwise be without this program.

Medicaid Program; Premiums and Cost Sharing
This final rule revises the November 25, 2008 final rule entitled, ``Medicaid Programs; Premiums and Cost Sharing (73 FR 71828),'' to address public comments received during reopened comment periods, and to reflect relevant statutory changes made in section 5006(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act). This revised final rule implements and interprets section 1916A of the Social Security Act (the Act), which was added by sections 6041, 6042, and 6043 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), amended by section 405(a)(1) of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) and further amended by section 5006(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act). These provisions increase State flexibility to impose premiums and cost sharing for coverage of certain individuals whose family income exceeds specified levels. This revised rule also provides a further opportunity for public comment on revisions made to implement and interpret section 5006(a) of the Recovery Act. The Recovery Act prohibits States from charging premiums and cost sharing under Medicaid to Indians furnished items or services directly by the Indian Health Service, Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations, or Urban Indian Organizations or through referral under contract health services.

Medicaid; Federal Funding for Medicaid Eligibility Determination and Enrollment Activities
This proposed rule would revise Medicaid regulations for Mechanized Claims Processing and Information Retrieval Systems. Specifically, we are proposing to amend the definition of Mechanized Claims Processing and Information Retrieval Systems to include systems used for eligibility determination, enrollment, and eligibility reporting activities. We propose to modify our regulations so that the enhanced Federal financial participation (FFP) is available for design, development and installation or enhancement of eligibility determination systems until December 31, 2015, with enhanced FFP for maintenance and operations available for such systems beyond that date in certain circumstances. We also propose that all Medicaid Management Information Systems (MMISs) meet certain defined standards and conditions in terms of timeliness, accuracy, efficiency, and integrity and that they achieve high positive levels of consumer experience, acceptance and satisfaction in order to receive enhanced FFP.

Regulations Under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008
The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (``EEOC'' or ``Commission'') is issuing a final rule to implement Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 (``GINA''). Congress enacted Title II of GINA to protect job applicants, current and former employees, labor union members, and apprentices and trainees from discrimination based on their genetic information. Title II of GINA requires the EEOC to issue implementing regulations. The Commission issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register on March 2, 2009, for a sixty-day notice and comment period that ended on May 1, 2009. After consideration of the public comments, the Commission has revised portions of both the final rule and the preamble.

This final rule sets forth an update to the Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS) rates, including: the national standardized 60-day episode rates, the national per-visit rates, the nonroutine medical supply (NRS) conversion factors, and the low utilization payment amount (LUPA) add-on payment amounts, under the Medicare prospective payment system for HHAs effective January 1, 2011. This rule also updates the wage index used under the HH PPS and, in accordance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act), updates the HH PPS outlier policy. In addition, this rule revises the home health agency (HHA) capitalization requirements. This rule further adds clarifying language to the ``skilled services'' section. The rule finalizes a 3.79 percent reduction to rates for CY 2011 to account for changes in case-mix, which are unrelated to real changes in patient acuity. Finally, this rule incorporates new legislative requirements regarding face-to-face encounters with providers related to home health and hospice care.

The program will apply to payments for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012, in accordance with section 1886(o) of the Social Security Act (as added by section 3001(a) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148), enacted on March 23, 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub.

The measures we are proposing to initially adopt for the program are a subset of the measures that we have already adopted for the existing Medicare Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting Program (Hospital IQR program), formerly known as the Reporting Hospital Quality Data for the Annual Payment Update Program (RHQDAPU), and we are proposing, based on whether a hospital meets or exceeds the performance standards that we are proposing to establish with respect to the measures, to reward the hospital based on its actual performance, rather than simply its reporting of data for those measures.

This proposed rule would exempt the system of records (09-15- 0054, the National Practitioner Data Bank for Adverse Information on Physicians and Other Health Care Practitioners, HHS/HRSA/BHPr) for the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB) from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. The exemption is necessary due to the recent expansion of the NPDB under section 1921 of the Social Security Act to include the investigative materials compiled for law enforcement purposes reported to the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB). The system of records for the HIPDB has an exemption from certain provisions of the Privacy Act. In order to maintain the exemption for the HIPDB investigative materials, which are now also available through the NPDB, it is necessary to expand the same privacy act exemptions for the HIPDB to the NPDB. This rule specifically seeks public comments on the proposed exemption.

HIPAA Privacy Rule Accounting of Disclosures Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or ``the Department'') is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule's standard for accounting of disclosures of protected health information. The purpose of these modifications is, in part, to implement the statutory requirement under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (``the HITECH Act'' or ``the Act'') to require covered entities and business associates to account for disclosures of protected health information to carry out treatment, payment, and health care operations if such disclosures are through an electronic health record. Pursuant to both the HITECH Act and its more general authority under HIPAA, the Department proposes to expand the accounting provision to provide individuals with the right to receive an access report indicating who has accessed electronic protected health information in a designated record set. Under its more general authority under HIPAA, the Department also proposes changes to the existing accounting requirements to improve their workability and effectiveness.

Medicaid Program; Payment Adjustment for Provider-Preventable Conditions Including Health Care-Acquired Conditions
This final rule will implement section 2702 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act which directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue Medicaid regulations effective as of July 1, 2011 prohibiting Federal payments to States under section 1903 of the Social Security Act for any amounts expended for providing medical assistance for health care-acquired conditions specified in the regulation. It will also authorize States to identify other provider- preventable conditions for which Medicaid payment will be prohibited.

Administrative Simplification: Adoption of Operating Rules for Eligibility for a Health Plan and Health Care Claim Status Transactions
Section 1104 of the Administrative Simplification provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (hereafter referred to as the Affordable Care Act) establishes new requirements for administrative transactions that will improve the utility of the existing HIPAA transactions and reduce administrative costs. Specifically, in section 1104(b)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required the adoption of operating rules for the health care industry and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ``adopt a single set of operating rules for each transaction * * * with the goal of creating as much uniformity in the implementation of the electronic standards as possible.'' This interim final rule with comment period adopts operating rules for two Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) transactions: eligibility for a health plan and health care claim status. This rule also defines the term ``operating rules'' and explains the role of operating rules in relation to the adopted transaction standards. In general, transaction standards adopted under HIPAA enable electronic data interchange through a common interchange structure, thus minimizing the industry's reliance on multiple formats. Operating rules, in turn, attempt to define the rights and responsibilities of all parties, security requirements, transmission formats, response times, liabilities, exception processing, error resolution and more, in order to facilitate successful interoperability between data systems of different entities.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Establishment of Exchanges and Qualified Health Plans
This proposed rule would implement the new Affordable Insurance Exchanges (``Exchanges''), consistent with title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-148) as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (Pub. L. 111-152), referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. The Exchanges will provide competitive marketplaces for individuals and small employers to directly compare available private health insurance options on the basis of price, quality, and other factors. The Exchanges, which will become operational by January 1, 2014, will help enhance competition in the health insurance market, improve choice of affordable health insurance, and give small businesses the same purchasing clout as large businesses. A detailed Preliminary Regulatory Impact Analysis associated with this proposed rule is available at http://cciio.cms.gov under ``Regulations and Guidance.'' A summary of the aforementioned analysis is included as part of this proposed rule.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Standards Related to Reinsurance, Risk Corridors and Risk Adjustment
This proposed rule would implement standards for States related to reinsurance and risk adjustment, and for health insurance issuers related to reinsurance, risk corridors, and risk adjustment consistent with title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. These programs will mitigate the impact of potential adverse selection and stabilize premiums in the individual and small group markets as insurance reforms and the Affordable Insurance Exchanges (``Exchanges'') are implemented, starting in 2014. The transitional State-based reinsurance program serves to reduce the uncertainty of insurance risk in the individual market by making payments for high- cost cases. The temporary Federally-administered risk corridor program serves to protect against uncertainty in the Exchange by limiting the extent of issuer losses (and gains). On an ongoing basis, the State- based risk adjustment program is intended to provide adequate payments to health insurance issuers that attract high-risk populations (such as individuals with chronic conditions).

Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment; Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment; Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program; Physician Self-Referral; and Provider Agreement Regulations on Patient Notification Requirements
This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system. In this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the OPPS. These proposed changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2012. In addition, this proposed rule would update the revised Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system. In this proposed rule, we set forth the proposed relative payment weights and payment amounts for services furnished in ASCs, specific HCPCS codes to which these proposed changes would apply, and other proposed ratesetting information for the CY 2012 ASC payment system. These proposed changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2012. We are proposing to revise the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (IQR) Program, add new requirements for ASC Quality Reporting System, and make additional changes to provisions of the Hospital Inpatient Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program. We also are proposing to allow eligible hospitals and CAHs participating in the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program to meet the clinical quality measure reporting requirement of the EHR Incentive Program for payment year 2012 by participating in the 2012 Medicare EHR Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilot. In addition, we are proposing to make changes to the rules governing the whole hospital and rural provider exceptions to the physician self-referral prohibition for expansion of facility capacity and changes to provider agreement regulations on patient notification requirements.

Human Subjects Research Protections: Enhancing Protections for Research Subjects and Reducing Burden, Delay, and Ambiguity for Investigators
The Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to request comment on how current regulations for protecting human subjects who participate in research might be modernized and revised to be more effective. This ANPRM seeks comment on how to better protect human subjects who are involved in research, while facilitating valuable research and reducing burden, delay, and ambiguity for investigators. The current regulations governing human subjects research were developed years ago when research was predominantly conducted at universities, colleges, and medical institutions, and each study generally took place at only a single site. Although the regulations have been amended over the years, they have not kept pace with the evolving human research enterprise, the proliferation of multi-site clinical trials and observational studies, the expansion of health services research, research in the social and behavioral sciences, and research involving databases, the Internet, and biological specimen repositories, and the use of advanced technologies, such as genomics. Revisions to the current human subjects regulations are being considered because OSTP and HHS believe these changes would strengthen protections for research subjects.

Medicare Program; Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System for Federal Fiscal Year 2012; Changes in Size and Square Footage of Inpatient Rehabilitation Units and Inpatient Psychiatric Units
This final rule will implement section 3004 of the Affordable Care Act, which establishes a new quality reporting program that provides for a 2 percent reduction in the annual increase factor beginning in 2014 for failure to report quality data to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This final rule will also update the prospective payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2012 (for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2011 and on or before September 30, 2012) as required under section 1886(j)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Section 1886(j)(5) of the Act requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register on or before the August 1 that precedes the start of each FY the classification and weighting factors for the IRF prospective payment system (PPS) case-mix groups and a description of the methodology and data used in computing the prospective payment rates for that fiscal year. We are also consolidating, clarifying, and revising existing policies regarding IRF hospitals and IRF units of hospitals to eliminate unnecessary confusion and enhance consistency. Furthermore, in accordance with the general principles of the President's January 18, 2011 Executive Order entitled ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' we are amending existing regulatory provisions regarding ''new'' facilities and changes in the bed size and square footage of IRFs and inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs) to improve clarity and remove obsolete material.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment; Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment; Hospital Value-Based Purchasing Program; Physician Self-Referral; and Patient Notification Requirements in Provider Agreements
This final rule with comment period revises the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) for CY 2012 to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system. In this final rule with comment period, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the OPPS. In addition, this final rule with comment period updates the revised Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system. In this final rule with comment period, we set forth the relative payment weights and payment amounts for services furnished in ASCs, specific HCPCS codes to which these changes apply, and other ratesetting information for the CY 2012 ASC payment system. We are revising the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program, adding new requirements for ASC Quality Reporting System, and making additional changes to provisions of the Hospital Inpatient Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program. We also are allowing eligible hospitals and CAHs participating in the Medicare Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program to meet the clinical quality measure reporting requirement of the EHR Incentive Program for payment year 2012 by participating in the 2012 Medicare EHR Incentive Program Electronic Reporting Pilot. Finally, we are making changes to the rules governing the whole hospital and rural provider exceptions to the physician self-referral prohibition for expansion of facility capacity and changes to provider agreement regulations on patient notification requirements.

Filings Required of Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangements and Certain Other Related Entities
This document contains a proposed rule under title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) that, upon adoption, would implement reporting requirements for multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs) and certain other entities that offer or provide health benefits for employees of two or more employers. The proposal amends existing reporting rules to incorporate new provisions enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to more clearly address the reporting obligations of MEWAs that are ERISA plans. This regulation is designed to impose the minimal amount of burden on legally compliant MEWAs and entities claiming exception (ECEs) while implementing the Secretary's authority to take enforcement action against fraudulent or abusive MEWAs included in the Affordable Care Act and working to protect health benefits for businesses and their employees. This proposed rule implements the new provisions while preserving the filing structure and provisions of the 2003 regulations which direct plan MEWAs and non-plan MEWAs to report annually and file upon registration or origination. Elsewhere in this edition of the Federal Register, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the Secretary's new enforcement authority with respect to MEWAs and Notices of proposed revisions of the Form M-1 and the Form 5500.

Homeless Management Information Systems Requirements
This proposed rule provides for the establishment of regulations for Homeless Management Information Systems (HMIS), which are the local information technology systems that HUD recipients and subrecipients use for homeless assistance programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (the McKinney-Vento Act). The Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act of 2009 (HEARTH Act), enacted into law on May 20, 2009, in addition to consolidating and amending programs authorized by the McKinney-Vento Act, codifies in law the Continuum of Care planning process, as well as certain data collection requirements integral to HMIS. The HEARTH Act requires that HUD ensure operation of and consistent participation by recipients and subrecipients in HMIS. While Continuums of Care have been using HMIS for several years, this proposed rule would add a new part to the Code of Federal Regulations to regulate the administration of HMIS and collection of data using HMIS, as provided for by the HEARTH Act. In addition, this proposed rule would make corresponding changes to HUD's regulations for Consolidated Submissions for Community Planning and Development Programs, at 24 CFR part 91; the Emergency Solutions Grants program, at 24 CFR part 576; the Shelter Plus Care Program, at 24 CFR part 582; and the Supportive Housing Program, at 24 CFR part 583.

Specifications for Medical Examinations of Underground Coal Miners
With this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposes to modify its regulations on Specifications for Medical Examinations of Underground Coal Miners. Existing regulations establish specifications for providing, interpreting, classifying, and submitting film-based roentgenograms (now commonly called chest radiographs or X-rays) of underground coal miners for the surveillance of coal workers' pneumoconiosis (black lung) under the Coal Workers' Health Surveillance Program, administered by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). The current standards specify requirements that permit the use of film- based radiography systems only; proposed amendments would retain those standards (with minor modifications that reflect more commonly-used terms) and add a parallel set of standards to specify requirements that would permit the use of digital radiography systems. An additional proposed amendment would require coal mine operators to provide NIOSH with employee rosters to assist the Program in improving participation by miners.

This proposed rule addresses the hospital-specific limitation on Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments under the Social Security Act. Under this limitation, DSH payments to a hospital cannot exceed the uncompensated costs of furnishing hospital services by the hospital to individuals who are Medicaid-eligible or ``have no health insurance (or other source of third party coverage) for the services furnished during the year.'' This rule would provide that the quoted phrase would refer in context to a lack of coverage on a service-specific basis, so that the calculation of uncompensated care for purposes of the hospital-specific DSH limit would include the cost of each service furnished to an individual who had no health insurance or other source of third party coverage for that service.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also is removing Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 61, which implemented the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act, the statutory authority for this regulatory action, was designed to eliminate duplicative data reporting and access requirements between the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (established under section 1128E of the Social Security Act) and the National Practitioner Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to establish a transition period to transfer all data in the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank to the National Practitioner Data Bank, and, once completed, to cease operations of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Information previously collected and disclosed through the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank will then be collected and disclosed through the National Practitioner Data Bank. This regulatory action consolidates the collection and disclosure of information from both data banks into one part of the CFR.

Protective Force Personnel Medical, Physical Readiness, Training, and Access Authorization Standards
The Department of Energy (DOE or Department) proposes to revise the regulation governing the standards for medical, physical performance, training, and access authorizations for protective force (PF) personnel employed by contractors providing security services to the Department. The existing version of this regulation was promulgated in 1993 and substantial portions of the regulation date to the mid- 1980s. Since 1993 DOE policy has placed greater reliance upon technology, vehicular response, and increased firepower and, correspondingly, has reduced its reliance upon the ability of PF personnel to perform the running tasks required in the current regulation. Furthermore, this shift in emphasis has placed a greater premium upon the retention of mature, tactically experienced, and technically sophisticated personnel, particularly since these personnel represent a considerable investment by DOE in security background investigations and training. The proposed revisions bring DOE PF medical and physical readiness requirements in line with these tactical and organizational priorities. The proposed revisions reduce the exposure of the PF population to injuries related to physical readiness testing. They would create a PF readiness classification designed specifically to encourage the retention of experienced personnel. The revisions would further ensure that PF personnel would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis on their ability to perform the essential functions of their positions without posing a direct threat to themselves or site personnel, the facility, or the general public. The proposed revisions would further ensure that reasonable accommodations would be considered before a determination is made that an individual cannot perform the essential functions of a particular position. The proposed rule also would provide for new medical review processes for PF personnel disqualified from medical certification. The proposed rule would ensure that DOE PF medical and physical readiness requirements would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Amendment Act of 2009 (ADAAA), the Privacy Act and DOE implementing regulations, and changes in DOE policy regarding PF operations made since the publication of the last version of this rule. In addition, the proposed rule would promote operational efficiency through greater emphasis on aligning training with mission-essential tasks and the increased use of simulation technologies. Finally, the proposed revision would update the regulation to reflect organizational changes in the Office of Health, Safety and Security and the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Standards Related to Reinsurance, Risk Corridors and Risk Adjustment

These programs will mitigate the impact of potential adverse selection and stabilize premiums in the individual and small group markets as insurance reforms and the Affordable Insurance Exchanges (``Exchanges'') are implemented, starting in 2014. The transitional State-based reinsurance program serves to reduce uncertainty by sharing risk in the individual market through making payments for high claims costs for enrollees. The temporary Federally administered risk corridors program serves to protect against uncertainty in rate setting by qualified health plans sharing risk in losses and gains with the Federal government. The permanent State-based risk adjustment program provides payments to health insurance issuers that disproportionately attract high-risk populations (such as individuals with chronic conditions).

National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners
FMCSA establishes a National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (National Registry) with requirements that all medical examiners who conduct physical examinations for interstate commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers meet the following criteria: Complete certain training concerning FMCSA's physical qualification standards, pass a test to verify an understanding of those standards, and maintain and demonstrate competence through periodic training and testing. Following establishment of the National Registry and a transition period, FMCSA will require that motor carriers and drivers use only those medical examiners on the Agency's National Registry and will only accept as valid medical examiner's certificates issued by medical examiners listed on the National Registry. FMCSA is developing the National Registry program to improve highway safety and driver health by requiring that medical examiners be trained and certified so they can determine effectively whether a CMV driver's medical fitness for duty meets FMCSA's standards.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Fiscal Year 2013 Rates; Hospitals' Resident Caps for Graduate Medical Education Payment Purposes; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers and for Ambulatory Surgical Centers
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems and to implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act) and other legislation. These changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012. We also are proposing to update the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of- increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012. We are proposing to update the payment policy and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes made by the Affordable Care Act. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012. In addition, we are proposing changes relating to determining a hospital's full-time equivalent (FTE) resident cap for the purpose of graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are proposing new requirements or revised requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS- exempt cancer hospitals, LTCHs, and inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs)) that are participating in Medicare. We also are proposing new administrative, data completeness, and extraordinary circumstance waivers or extension requests requirements, as well as a reconsideration process, for quality reporting by ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) that are participating in Medicare. We are proposing requirements for the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.

Nationwide Health Information Network: Conditions for Trusted Exchange
The nationwide health information network is defined as the set of standards, services, and policies that enable secure health information exchange over the Internet. Enacted in February 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to establish a governance mechanism for the nationwide health information network (section 3001(c)(8) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA)). This request for information (RFI) is being issued to request public comment on draft proposals the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is considering in anticipation of developing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to establish such a governance mechanism. This RFI seeks broad input on a range of topics, including: The creation of a voluntary program under which entities that facilitate electronic health information exchange could be validated with respect to their conformance to certain ONC-established ``conditions for trusted exchange (CTEs);'' the scope and requirements included in the initial CTEs; the processes that could be used to revise, adopt new, and retire CTEs, including but not limited to the standards development and adoption process provided in section 3004 and other relevant sections of the PHSA; and a process to classify the readiness for nationwide adoption and use of technical standards and implementation specifications to support interoperability related CTEs.

Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991
In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'' or ``Commission'') revises its rules to: require prior express written consent for all autodialed or prerecorded telemarketing calls to wireless numbers and for prerecorded calls to residential lines and, accordingly, eliminate the established business relationship exemption for such calls to residential lines while maintaining flexibility in the form of consent needed for purely informational calls; require all prerecorded telemarketing calls to allow consumers to opt out of future prerecorded telemarketing calls using an interactive, automated opt-out mechanism; and limit permissible abandoned calls on a per-calling campaign basis, in order to discourage intrusive calling campaigns. The Commision also exempts from its telemarketing requirements prerecorded calls to residential lines made by health care-related entities governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Taken together, today's actions offer consumers greater protection from intrusive telemarketing calls and protect consumers from unwanted autodialed or prerecorded telemarketing calls to wireless numbers and from unwanted prerecorded telemarketing calls to residential lines, also known as ``telemarketing robocalls,'' and maximize consistency with the analogous Telemarketing Sales Rule (``TSR'') of the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC''), as contemplated by the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act (``DNCIA'') in a way that reduces industry confusion about telemarketers' obligations and does not increase compliance burdens for most telemarketers.

Further, in accordance with Executive Order 13546, ``Optimizing the Security of Biological Select Agents and Toxins in the United States,'' HHS/CDC has designated those select agents and toxins that present the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure; or public confidence as ``Tier 1'' agents; established new security requirements for entities possessing Tier 1 agents, including the requirement to conduct pre- access assessments and on-going monitoring of personnel with access to Tier 1 agents and toxins; and made revisions to the regulations to clarify regulatory language concerning security, training, biosafety, and incident response.

This minimum payment level applies to specified primary care services furnished by a physician with a specialty designation of family medicine, general internal medicine, or pediatric medicine, and also applies to services rendered by these provider types paid by Medicaid managed care plans contracted by states to provide the primary care services. It also provides for 100 percent federal financial participation (FFP) for any increase in payment above the amounts that would be due for these services under the provisions of the approved Medicaid state plan, as of July 1, 2009. In other words, there will not be any additional cost to states for payments above the amount required by the 2009 rate methodology. In this final rule, we specify which services and types of physicians qualify for the minimum payment level in CYs 2013 and 2014, and the method for calculating the payment amount and any increase for which increased federal funding is due. In addition, this final rule will update the interim regional maximum fees that providers may charge for the administration of pediatric vaccines to federally vaccine-eligible children under the Pediatric Immunization Distribution Program, more commonly known as the Vaccines for Children (VFC) program.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs: Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment and Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment Systems and Quality Reporting Programs; Electronic Reporting Pilot; Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities Quality Reporting Program; Revision to Quality Improvement Organization Regulations
This final rule with comment period revises the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for CY 2013 to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. In this final rule with comment period, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare services paid under the OPPS and those paid under the ASC payment system. In addition, this final rule with comment period updates and refines the requirements for the Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting (OQR) Program, the ASC Quality Reporting (ASCQR) Program, and the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility (IRF) Quality Reporting Program. We are continuing the electronic reporting pilot for the Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program, and revising the various regulations governing Quality Improvement Organizations (QIOs), including the secure transmittal of electronic medical information, beneficiary complaint resolution and notification processes, and technical changes. The technical changes to the QIO regulations reflect CMS' commitment to the general principles of the President's Executive Order on Regulatory Reform, Executive Order 13563 (January 18, 2011).

Incentives for Nondiscriminatory Wellness Programs in Group Health Plans
This document proposes amendments to regulations, consistent with the Affordable Care Act, regarding nondiscriminatory wellness programs in group health coverage. Specifically, these proposed regulations would increase the maximum permissible reward under a health-contingent wellness program offered in connection with a group health plan (and any related health insurance coverage) from 20 percent to 30 percent of the cost of coverage. The proposed regulations would further increase the maximum permissible reward to 50 percent for wellness programs designed to prevent or reduce tobacco use. These regulations also include other proposed clarifications regarding the reasonable design of health-contingent wellness programs and the reasonable alternatives they must offer in order to avoid prohibited discrimination.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2014
This proposed rule provides further detail and parameters related to: the risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridors programs; cost-sharing reductions; user fees for a Federally- facilitated Exchange; advance payments of the premium tax credit; a Federally-facilitated Small Business Health Option Program; and the medical loss ratio program. The cost-sharing reductions and advanced payments of the premium tax credit, combined with new insurance market reforms, will significantly increase the number of individuals with health insurance coverage, particularly in the individual market. The premium stabilization programs--risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridors--will protect against adverse selection in the newly enrolled population. These programs, in combination with the medical loss ratio program and market reforms extending guaranteed availability (also known as guaranteed issue) protections and prohibiting the use of factors such as health status, medical history, gender, and industry of employment to set premium rates, will help to ensure that every American has access to high-quality, affordable health insurance.

Introduction to the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register describing regulatory actions they are developing that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' signed September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), and Office of Management and Budget memoranda implementing section 4 of that Order establish minimum standards for agencies' agendas, including specific types of information for each entry. The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) helps agencies fulfill these requirements. All Federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of the Unified Agenda. Editions of the Unified Agenda prior to fall 2007 were printed in their entirety in the Federal Register. Beginning with the fall 2007 edition, the Internet became the basic means for conveying regulatory agenda information to the maximum extent legally permissible. The complete 2012 Unified Agenda, which contains the regulatory agendas for 60 Federal agencies, is available to the public at http://reginfo.gov. The 2012 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register consists of agency regulatory flexibility agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agency regulatory flexibility agendas contain only those Agenda entries for rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and entries that have been selected for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act
This document proposes amendments to rules regarding coverage for certain preventive services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services, including certain contraceptive services, in non-exempt, non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. The proposed rules would amend the authorization to exempt group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) with respect to the requirement to cover contraceptive services. The proposed rules would also establish accommodations for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage offered in connection with such plans), including student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are religious institutions of higher education. This document also proposes related amendments to regulations concerning excepted benefits and Affordable Insurance Exchanges.

This Final Rule also amends the regulations to implement the Airline Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act, which establishes eligibility requirements specifically for airline flight crewmembers and flight attendants for FMLA leave and authorizes the Department to issue regulations regarding the calculation of leave for such employees as well as special recordkeeping requirements for their employers. In addition, the Final Rule includes clarifying changes concerning the calculation of intermittent or reduced schedule FMLA leave; reorganization of certain sections to enhance clarity; the removal of the forms from the regulations; and technical corrections to the current regulations.

Through contracts with OPM, health insurance issuers will offer at least two multi-State plans (MSPs) on each of the Affordable Insurance Exchanges (Exchanges). One of the issuers must be non-profit. Under the law, an MSPP issuer may phase in the States in which it offers coverage over 4 years, but it must offer MSPs on Exchanges in all States and the District of Columbia by the fourth year in which the MSPP issuer participates in the MSPP. This rule aims to balance adhering to the statutory goals of MSPP while aligning its standards to those applying to qualified health plans to promote a level playing field across health plans.

HIPAA Privacy Rule and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)
On January 16, 2013, President Barack Obama announced a series of Executive Actions to reduce gun violence in the United States, including efforts to improve the Federal government's background check system for the sale or transfer of firearms by licensed dealers, called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Among those persons disqualified from possessing or receiving firearms under Federal law are individuals who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution; found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity; or otherwise have been determined, through a formal adjudication process, to have a severe mental condition that results in the individuals presenting a danger to themselves or others or being incapable of managing their own affairs (referred to below as the ``mental health prohibitor''). Concerns have been raised that, in certain states, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule may be a barrier to States' reporting the identities of individuals subject to the mental health prohibitor to the NICS. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or ``the Department''), which administers the HIPAA regulations, is issuing this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit public comments on such barriers to reporting and ways in which these barriers can be addressed. In particular, we are considering creating an express permission in the HIPAA rules for reporting the relevant information to the NICS by those HIPAA covered entities responsible for involuntary commitments or the formal adjudications that would subject individuals to the mental health prohibitor, or that are otherwise designated by the States to report to the NICS. In addition, we are soliciting comments on the best methods to disseminate information on relevant HIPAA policies to State level entities that originate or maintain information that may be reported to NICS. Finally, we are soliciting public input on whether there are ways to mitigate any unintended adverse consequences for individuals seeking needed mental health services that may be caused by creating express regulatory permission to report relevant information to NICS. The Department will use the information it receives to determine how best to address these issues.

The most significant of these revisions include: changing the Incentive Reward Program potential reward amount for information on individuals and entities who are or have engaged in acts or omissions which resulted in the imposition of a sanction from 10 percent of the overpayments recovered in the case or $1,000, whichever is less, to 15 percent of the final amount collected applied to the first $66,000,000 for the sanctionable conduct; expanding the instances in which a felony conviction can serve as a basis for denial or revocation of a provider or supplier's enrollment; if certain criteria are met, enabling us to deny enrollment if the enrolling provider, supplier, or owner thereof had an ownership relationship with a previously enrolled provider or supplier that had a Medicare debt; enabling us to revoke Medicare billing privileges if we determine that the provider or supplier has a pattern or practice of submitting claims for services that fail to meet Medicare requirements; and limiting the ability of ambulance suppliers to ``backbill'' for services performed prior to enrollment. We believe this proposed rule would--increase the incentive for individuals to report information on individuals and entities that have or are engaged in sanctionable conduct; improve our ability to detect new fraud schemes; and help us ensure that fraudulent entities and individuals do not enroll in or maintain their enrollment in the Medicare program.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Proposed Fiscal Year 2014 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Hospital Conditions of Participation
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of the proposed changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act) and other legislation. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule. We also are proposing to update the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013. We are proposing to update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implement certain statutory changes made by the Affordable Care Act. Generally, these proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule. In addition, we are proposing a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are proposing to establish new requirements or revised requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, LTCHs, and inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs)) that are participating in Medicare. We are proposing to update policies relating to the Hospital Value- Based Purchasing (VBP) Program and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. In addition, we are proposing to revise the conditions of participation (CoPs) for hospitals relating to the administration of vaccines by nursing staff as well as the CoPs for critical access hospitals relating to the provision of acute care inpatient services.

State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program
The Administration on Aging (AoA) of the Administration for Community Living (ACL) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, with request for comments, to implement provisions of the Older Americans Act, the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program. This proposed rule replaces AoA's 1994 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Since 1992, the functions of this program have been delineated in the Older Americans Act; however, regulations have not been promulgated for any Title VII program. In the absence of regulatory guidance, there has been significant variation in the interpretation and implementation of these provisions among States. Recent inquiries from States and an AoA compliance review in one State have highlighted the difficulty of determining State compliance in carrying out the Long-Term Care Ombudsman program functions. This rulemaking provides the first regulatory guidance for States' Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs to provide clarity about implementation. HHS estimates that a number of states may need to update their statutes, regulations, policies and/or practices in order to operate the program consistent with federal law and this proposed regulation. The effective date of the rule is anticipated to be one year after publication of any final rule to allow States appropriate time for such changes, if needed. AoA anticipates little or no financial impact on the providers of long-term care ombudsman services, the consumers served by the program, or long-term care providers through implementation of the proposed rules. AoA believes that consumers (particularly residents of long-term care facilities) and long-term care providers will benefit from the implementation of these proposed rules. Consumers and other complainants across the country will receive services from the Long- Term Care Ombudsman program with less variation in the quality, efficiency, and consistency of service delivery. Long-term care ombudsmen and States will also benefit from the implementation of these proposed rules in the establishment and operation of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman program at the State and local levels. For years, States and long-term care ombudsmen at every level have reported to AoA that they have found some provisions of the Act confusing to implement. The proposed rule seeks to provide the clarity that program stakeholders have requested.

Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act
This document contains final regulations regarding coverage of certain preventive services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2713 of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services by non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. Among these services are women's preventive health services, as specified in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). As authorized by the current regulations, and consistent with the HRSA guidelines, group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) are exempt from the otherwise applicable requirement to cover certain contraceptive services. These final regulations simplify and clarify the religious employer exemption. These final regulations also establish accommodations with respect to the contraceptive coverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans), as well as student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education. These regulations also finalize related amendments to regulations concerning Affordable Insurance Exchanges.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Home Health Prospective Payment System Rate Update for CY 2014, Home Health Quality Reporting Requirements, and Cost Allocation of Home Health Survey Expenses
This proposed rule would update the Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS) rates, including the national, standardized 60- day episode payment rates, the national per-visit rates, the low- utilization payment adjustment (LUPA) add-on, the nonroutine medical supplies (NRS) conversion factor, and outlier payments under the Medicare prospective payment system for home health agencies (HHAs), effective January 1, 2014. As required by the Affordable Care Act, this rule also proposes rebasing adjustments, with a 4-year phase-in, to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rates; the national per- visit rates; and the NRS conversion factor. Finally, the proposed rule would also establish home health quality reporting requirements for CY 2014 payment and subsequent years and would clarify that a state Medicaid program must provide that, in certifying home health agencies, the state's designated survey agency must carry out certain other responsibilities that already apply to surveys of nursing facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF-IID), including sharing in the cost of HHA surveys. For that portion of costs attributable to Medicare and Medicaid, we would assign 50 percent to Medicare and 50 percent to Medicaid, the standard method that CMS and states use in the allocation of expenses related to surveys of SNF/NF nursing homes.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Fiscal Year 2014 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Hospital Conditions of Participation; Payment Policies Related to Patient Status
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of the changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act) and other legislation.

Specifically, this final rule outlines financial integrity and oversight standards with respect to Affordable Insurance Exchanges, qualified health plan (QHP) issuers in Federally-facilitated Exchanges (FFEs), and States with regard to the operation of risk adjustment and reinsurance programs. It also establishes additional standards for special enrollment periods, survey vendors that may conduct enrollee satisfaction surveys on behalf of QHP issuers, and issuer participation in an FFE, and makes certain amendments to definitions and standards related to the market reform rules. These standards, which include financial integrity provisions and protections against fraud and abuse, are consistent with Title I of the Affordable Care Act. This final rule also amends and adopts as final interim provisions set forth in the Amendments to the HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2014 interim final rule, published in the Federal Register on March 11, 2013, related to risk corridors and cost-sharing reduction reconciliation.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Home Health Prospective Payment System Rate Update for CY 2014, Home Health Quality Reporting Requirements, and Cost Allocation of Home Health Survey Expenses
This final rule will update the Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS) rates, including the national, standardized 60- day episode payment rates, the national per-visit rates, the low- utilization payment adjustment (LUPA) add-on, and the non-routine medical supply (NRS) conversion factor under the Medicare prospective payment system for home health agencies (HHAs), effective January 1, 2014. As required by the Affordable Care Act, this rule establishes rebasing adjustments, with a 4-year phase-in, to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rates; the national per-visit rates; and the NRS conversion factor. In addition, this final rule will remove 170 diagnosis codes from assignment to diagnosis groups within the HH PPS Grouper, effective January 1, 2014. Finally, this rule will establish home health quality reporting requirements for CY 2014 payment and subsequent years and will clarify that a state Medicaid program must provide that, in certifying HHAs, the state's designated survey agency carry out certain other responsibilities that already apply to surveys of nursing facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF-IID), including sharing in the cost of HHA surveys. For that portion of costs attributable to Medicare and Medicaid, we will assign 50 percent to Medicare and 50 percent to Medicaid, the standard method that CMS and states use in the allocation of expenses related to surveys of nursing homes.

Amendments include updating the provision under which electronic health records software is deemed interoperable; removing the electronic prescribing capability requirement; extending the sunset provision until December 31, 2021; limiting the scope of protected donors to exclude laboratory companies; and clarifying the condition that prohibits a donor from taking any action to limit or restrict the use, compatibility, or interoperability of the donated items or services.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Emergency Preparedness Requirements for Medicare and Medicaid Participating Providers and Suppliers
This proposed rule would establish national emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating providers and suppliers to ensure that they adequately plan for both natural and man-made disasters, and coordinate with federal, state, tribal, regional, and local emergency preparedness systems. It would also ensure that these providers and suppliers are adequately prepared to meet the needs of patients, residents, clients, and participants during disasters and emergency situations. We are proposing emergency preparedness requirements that 17 provider and supplier types must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since existing Medicare and Medicaid requirements vary across the types of providers and suppliers, we are also proposing variations in these requirements. These variations are based on existing statutory and regulatory policies and differing needs of each provider or supplier type and the individuals to whom they provide health care services. Despite these variations, our proposed regulations would provide generally consistent emergency preparedness requirements, enhance patient safety during emergencies for persons served by Medicare- and Medicaid-participating facilities, and establish a more coordinated and defined response to natural and man- made disasters.

Introduction to the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register describing regulatory actions they are developing that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' signed September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), and incorporated in Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review'' issued on January 18, 2011 (76 FR 3821) establish guidelines and procedures for agencies' agendas, including specific types of information for each entry. The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) helps agencies fulfill these requirements. All Federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of the Unified Agenda. The complete 2013 Unified Agenda and Regulatory Plan, which contains the regulatory agendas for 60 Federal agencies, is available to the public at http://reginfo.gov. The 2013 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register consists of agency regulatory flexibility agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agency regulatory flexibility agendas contain only those Agenda entries for rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and entries that have been selected for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or ``the Department'') is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule to expressly permit certain HIPAA covered entities to disclose to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) the identities of individuals who are subject to a Federal ``mental health prohibitor'' that disqualifies them from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving a firearm. The NICS is a national system maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct background checks on persons who may be disqualified from receiving firearms based on federally prohibited categories or State law. Among the persons subject to the Federal mental health prohibitor are individuals who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution; found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity; or otherwise have been determined by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority to be a danger to themselves or others or to lack the mental capacity to contract or manage their own affairs, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease. Under this proposal, only covered entities with lawful authority to make adjudication or commitment decisions that make individuals subject to the Federal mental health prohibitor, or that serve as repositories of information for NICS reporting purposes, would be permitted to disclose the information needed for these purposes. This disclosure would be restricted to limited demographic and certain other information and would not include medical records, or any mental health information beyond the indication that the individual is subject to the Federal mental health prohibitor. HHS notes that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed clarifications to the regulatory definitions relevant to the Federal mental health prohibitor. The DOJ proposal is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. While commenters should consider this proposed regulation in light of the clarifications proposed in DOJ's proposal, we note that those clarifications would not change how this proposed HIPAA permission would operate.

CLIA Program and HIPAA Privacy Rule; Patients' Access to Test Reports
This final rule amends the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations to specify that, upon the request of a patient (or the patient's personal representative), laboratories subject to CLIA may provide the patient, the patient's personal representative, or a person designated by the patient, as applicable, with copies of completed test reports that, using the laboratory's authentication process, can be identified as belonging to that patient. Subject to conforming amendments, the final rule retains the existing provisions that require release of test reports only to authorized persons and, if applicable, to the persons responsible for using the test reports and to the laboratory that initially requested the test. In addition, this final rule amends the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to access test reports directly from laboratories subject to HIPAA (and to direct that copies of those test reports be transmitted to persons or entities designated by the individual) by removing the exceptions for CLIA-certified laboratories and CLIA-exempt laboratories from the provision that provides individuals with the right of access to their protected health information. These changes to the CLIA regulations and the HIPAA Privacy Rule provide individuals with a greater ability to access their health information, empowering them to take a more active role in managing their health and health care.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Exchange and Insurance Market Standards for 2015 and Beyond
This proposed rule addresses various requirements applicable to health insurance issuers, Affordable Insurance Exchanges (``Exchanges''), Navigators, non-Navigator assistance personnel, and other entities under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act). Specifically, the rule proposes standards related to product discontinuation and renewal, quality reporting, non-discrimination standards, minimum certification standards and responsibilities of qualified health plan (QHP) issuers, the Small Business Health Options Program, and enforcement remedies in Federally-facilitated Exchanges. It also proposes: A modification of HHS's allocation of reinsurance contributions collected if those contributions do not meet our projections; certain changes to the ceiling on allowable administrative expenses in the risk corridors calculation; modifications to the way we calculate certain cost-sharing parameters so that we round those parameters down to the nearest $50 increment; certain approaches we are considering to index the required contribution used to determine eligibility for an exemption from the shared responsibility payment under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code; grounds for imposing civil money penalties on persons who provide false or fraudulent information to the Exchange and on persons who improperly use or disclose information; updated standards for the consumer assistance programs; standards related to the opt-out provisions for self-funded, non-Federal governmental plans and the individual market provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; standards for recognition of certain types of foreign group health coverage as minimum essential coverage; amendments to Exchange appeals standards and coverage enrollment and termination standards; and time-limited adjustments to the standards relating to the medical loss ratio program.

Lowering Miners' Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is revising the Agency's existing standards on miners' occupational exposure to respirable coal mine dust in order to: Lower the existing exposure limits; provide for full-shift sampling; redefine the term ``normal production shift''; and add reexamination and decertification requirements for persons certified to sample for dust, and maintain and calibrate sampling devices. In addition, the rule provides for single shift compliance sampling by MSHA inspectors, establishes sampling requirements for mine operators' use of the Continuous Personal Dust Monitor (CPDM), requires operator corrective action on a single, full- shift operator sample, changes the averaging method to determine compliance on operator samples, and expands requirements for medical surveillance of coal miners. Chronic exposure to respirable coal mine dust causes lung diseases that can lead to permanent disability and death. The final rule will greatly improve health protections for coal miners by reducing their occupational exposure to respirable coal mine dust and by lowering the risk that they will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity over their working lives.

Medicare Program; FY 2015 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update; Hospice Quality Reporting Requirements and Process and Appeals for Part D Payment for Drugs for Beneficiaries Enrolled in Hospice
This proposed rule would update the hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year (FY) 2015 and continue the phase out of the wage index budget neutrality adjustment factor (BNAF). This rule provides an update on hospice payment reform analyses and solicits comments on ``terminal illness'' and ``related conditions'' definitions, and on a process and appeals for Part D payment for drugs, while beneficiaries are under a hospice election. Also, this rule proposes timeframes for filing the notice of election and the notice of termination/revocation; adding the attending physician to the hospice election form; a requirement that hospices complete their hospice inpatient and aggregate cap determinations within 5 months after the cap year ends, and remit any overpayments; and updates for the hospice quality reporting program. In addition, this rule would provide guidance on determining hospice eligibility, information on the delay in the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), and would further clarify how hospices are to report diagnoses on hospice claims. Finally, the rule proposes to make a technical regulatory text change.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Proposed Fiscal Year 2015 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Reasonable Compensation Equivalents for Physician Services in Excluded Teaching Hospitals; Provider Administrative Appeals and Judicial Review; Enforcement Provisions for Organ Transplant Centers; and Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of the proposed changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act), the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and other legislation. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule. We also are proposing to update the rate-of- increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. We also are proposing to update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and to implement certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition we are proposing to revise the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and to retire the ``5 percent'' payment adjustment for co-located LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act will apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond. However, in light of the degree of forthcoming change, we discuss changes infra and request public feedback to inform our proposals for FY 2016 in this proposed rule as well. In addition, we are proposing to make a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are proposing to establish new requirements or revise requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs) that are participating in Medicare. We are proposing to update policies relating to the Hospital Value- Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. In addition, we are proposing changes to the regulations governing provider administrative appeals and judicial review relating to appropriate claims in provider cost reports; updates to the reasonable compensation equivalent (RCE) limits for services furnished by physicians to teaching hospitals excluded from the IPPS; regulatory revisions to broaden the specified uses of risk adjustment data and to specify the conditions for release of risk adjustment data to entities outside of CMS; and changes to the enforcement procedures for organ transplant centers. We are proposing to align the reporting and submission timelines for clinical quality measures for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) with the reporting and submission timelines for the Hospital IQR Program. In addition, we provide guidance and clarification of certain policies for eligible hospitals and CAHs such as our policy for reporting zero denominators on clinical quality measures and our policy for case threshold exemptions.

Investigation Procedures
The NTSB is proposing to amend its regulations that address the NTSB's investigation procedures. Specifically, the NTSB proposes to organize regulations into distinct mode-specific subparts, where appropriate. While some of these proposed amendments are merely technical in nature, this notice proposes several substantive changes. In addition, in this rulemaking, the NTSB proposes including its party agreement form as an appendix and solicits comment on revisions to the party agreement.

Medicare Program; FY 2015 Hospice Wage Index and Payment Rate Update; Hospice Quality Reporting Requirements and Process and Appeals for Part D Payment for Drugs for Beneficiaries Enrolled in Hospice
This final rule will update the hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year (FY) 2015 and continue the phase-out of the wage index budget neutrality adjustment factor (BNAF). This rule provides an update on hospice payment reform analyses, potential definitions of ``terminal illness'' and ``related conditions,'' and information on potential processes and appeals for Part D payment for drugs while beneficiaries are under a hospice election. This rule will specify timeframes for filing the notice of election and the notice of termination/revocation; add the attending physician to the hospice election form, and require hospices to document changes to the attending physician; require hospices to complete their hospice aggregate cap determinations within 5 months after the cap year ends, and remit any overpayments; and update the hospice quality reporting program. In addition, this rule will provide guidance on determining hospice eligibility; information on the delay in the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM); and will further clarify how hospices are to report diagnoses on hospice claims. Finally, the rule will make a technical regulations text change.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Fiscal Year 2015 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Reasonable Compensation Equivalents for Physician Services in Excluded Hospitals and Certain Teaching Hospitals; Provider Administrative Appeals and Judicial Review; Enforcement Provisions for Organ Transplant Centers; and Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of these changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act), the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and other legislation. These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, unless otherwise specified in this final rule. We also are updating the rate- of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. We also are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition, we discuss our proposals on the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and on retiring the ``5 percent'' payment adjustment for co-located LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond. In addition, we are making a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are establishing new requirements or revising requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS- exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs) that are participating in Medicare. We are updating policies relating to the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. In addition, we are making technical corrections to the regulations governing provider administrative appeals and judicial review; updating the reasonable compensation equivalent (RCE) limits, and revising the methodology for determining such limits, for services furnished by physicians to certain teaching hospitals and hospitals excluded from the IPPS; making regulatory revisions to broaden the specified uses of Medicare Advantage (MA) risk adjustment data and to specify the conditions for release of such risk adjustment data to entities outside of CMS; and making changes to the enforcement procedures for organ transplant centers. We are aligning the reporting and submission timelines for clinical quality measures for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) with the reporting and submission timelines for the Hospital IQR Program. In addition, we provide guidance and clarification of certain policies for eligible hospitals and CAHs such as our policy for reporting zero denominators on clinical quality measures and our policy for case threshold exemptions. In this document, we are finalizing two interim final rules with comment period relating to criteria for disproportionate share hospital uncompensated care payments and extensions of temporary changes to the payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals and of the Medicare- Dependent, Small Rural Hospital (MDH) Program.

Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act
This document proposes a change to the definition of an eligible organization that can avail itself of an accommodation with respect to coverage of certain preventive services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2713 of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services by non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. Among these services are women's preventive health services, as specified in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). As authorized by the current regulations, and consistent with the HRSA Guidelines, group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) are exempt from the otherwise applicable requirement to cover certain contraceptive services. Additionally, under current regulations, accommodations are available with respect to the contraceptive coverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans), and student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education, that effectively exempt them from this requirement. The regulations establish a mechanism for separately furnishing payments for contraceptive services on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of the group health plans of eligible organizations that avail themselves of an accommodation, and enrollees and dependents of student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education that avail themselves of an accommodation. These rules propose and seek comments on potential changes to the definition of ``eligible organization'' in the Departments' regulations in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), to ensure that participants and beneficiaries in group health plans (and enrollees and dependents in student health insurance coverage arranged by institutions of higher education) obtain, without additional cost, coverage of the full range of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive services, as prescribed by a health care provider, while respecting certain closely held for-profit entities' religion-based objections to contraceptive coverage. These proposed rules also seek comments on any additional steps the government should take to help ensure coverage of the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing, for participants and beneficiaries in group health plans of such entities (and enrollees and dependents in student health insurance coverage arranged by such entities that are institutions of higher education).

Occupational Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting Requirements-NAICS Update and Reporting Revisions
OSHA is issuing a final rule to update the appendix to its Injury and Illness Recording and Reporting regulation. The appendix contains a list of industries that are partially exempt from requirements to keep records of work-related injuries and illnesses due to relatively low occupational injury and illness rates. The updated appendix is based on more recent injury and illness data and lists industry groups classified by the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The current appendix lists industries classified by Standard Industrial Classification (SIC). The final rule also revises the requirements for reporting work- related fatality, injury, and illness information to OSHA. The current regulation requires employers to report work-related fatalities and in- patient hospitalizations of three or more employees within eight hours of the event. The final rule retains the requirement for employers to report work-related fatalities to OSHA within eight hours of the event but amends the regulation to require employers to report all work- related in-patient hospitalizations, as well as amputations and losses of an eye, to OSHA within 24 hours of the event.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Standard Unique Health Identifier for Health Care Providers
This final rule establishes the standard for a unique health identifier for health care providers for use in the health care system and announces the adoption of the National Provider Identifier (NPI) as that standard. It also establishes the implementation specifications for obtaining and using the standard unique health identifier for health care providers. The implementation specifications set the requirements that must be met by ``covered entities'': Health plans, health care clearinghouses, and those health care providers who transmit any health information in electronic form in connection with a transaction for which the Secretary has adopted a standard (known as ``covered health care providers''). Covered entities must use the identifier in connection with standard transactions. The use of the NPI will improve the Medicare and Medicaid programs, and other Federal health programs and private health programs, and the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care industry in general, by simplifying the administration of the health care system and enabling the efficient electronic transmission of certain health information. This final rule implements some of the requirements of the Administrative Simplification subtitle F of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates and Policy Changes
This rule proposes an update to the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The payment amounts and factors used to determine the proposed updated Federal rates that are described in this proposed rule have been determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related groups (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and will continue to be effective each October 1. The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2004, through June 30, 2005, would also be derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. In this proposed rule, we also are proposing to make clarifications to the existing policy regarding the designation of a satellite of a LTCH as an independent LTCH. In addition, we are proposing to expand the existing interrupted stay policy and proposing a change in the procedure for counting days in the average length of stay calculation for Medicare patients for hospitals qualifying as LTCHs.

Fair Credit Reporting Medical Information Regulations
The OCC, Board, FDIC, OTS, and NCUA (Agencies) are publishing for comment proposed regulations implementing section 411 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act). Public Law 108-159, 117 Stat. 1952. The FACT Act substantially amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA or Act), 15 U.S.C. 1681 et seq. Section 411(a) of the FACT Act adds a new section 603(g)(1) to the FCRA to restrict the circumstances under which consumer reporting agencies may furnish consumer reports that contain medical information about consumers. Section 411(a) of the FACT Act also adds a new section 604(g)(2) to the FCRA to prohibit creditors from obtaining or using medical information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit. The Agencies are required to prescribe regulations that permit creditors to obtain or use medical information for eligibility purposes where necessary and appropriate to protect legitimate operational, transactional, risk, consumer, and other needs, consistent with the Congressional intent to restrict the use of medical information for inappropriate purposes. In addition, section 411(b) of the FACT Act adds a new section 603(d)(3) to the FCRA to restrict the sharing of medical information and related lists or descriptions with affiliates. Specifically, section 603(d)(3) provides that the standard exclusions from the definition of ``consumer report'' contained in section 603(d)(2)--such as sharing transaction or experience information about a consumer among affiliates or sharing other information among affiliates after providing the consumer notice and an opportunity to opt-out--do not apply if medical-related information is disclosed to an affiliate. Medical-related information includes medical information, an individualized list or description based on payment transactions for medical products or services, or an aggregate list of identified consumers based on payment transactions for medical products or services. The provisions of section 603(d)(3) do not apply if the sharing falls within certain exceptions, such as in connection with the business of insurance or annuities or for any purpose described in section 502(e) of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLB Act), Public Law 106- 102. Section 411(b) authorizes the Agencies to promulgate additional exceptions by regulation or order, as determined by the Agencies to be appropriate or necessary. The Agencies generally provide a 60-day period for the public to comment on the burdens associated with proposed rules. In this case, however, the Agencies believe that a 30-day comment period is appropriate because the statute was enacted in December 2003 and imposes a statutory deadline for the final rule of June 4, 2004.

Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit
This proposed rule would implement the new Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. This new voluntary prescription drug benefit program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003, in section 101 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). The addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare represents a landmark change to the Medicare program that will significantly improve the health care coverage available to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA specifies that the prescription drug benefit program will become available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006. Please see the executive summary in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION section for further synopsis of this rule.

Medicare Program; Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2005 Rates
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems; and to implement a number of changes made by the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 that was enacted on December 8, 2003. In addition, in the Addendum to this final rule, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2004. We also are setting forth rate-of-increase limits as well as policy changes for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. Among the policy changes that we are making are: Changes to the classification of cases to the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs); changes to the long-term care (LTC)-DRGs and relative weights; changes in the wage data, labor-related share of the wage index, and the geographic area designations used to compute the wage index; changes in the qualifying threshold criteria for and the approval of new technologies and medical services for add-on payments; changes to the policies governing postacute care transfers; changes to payments to hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education; changes to the payment adjustment for disproportionate share rural hospitals; changes in requirements and payments to critical access hospitals (CAHs); changes to the disclosure of information requirements for Quality Improvement Organization (QIOs); and changes in the hospital conditions of participation for discharge planning and fire safety requirements for certain health care facilities.

Medicare Program; Revisions to Payment Policies Under the Physician Fee Schedule for Calendar Year 2005
This final rule refines the resource-based practice expense relative value units (RVUs) and makes other changes to Medicare Part B payment policy. These policy changes concern: supplemental survey data for practice expense; updated geographic practice cost indices for physician work and practice expense; updated malpractice RVUs; revised requirements for supervision of therapy assistants; revised payment rules for low osmolar contrast media; changes to payment policies for physicians and practitioners managing dialysis patients; clarification of care plan oversight requirements; revised requirements for supervision of diagnostic psychological testing services; clarifications to the policies affecting therapy services; revised requirements for assignment of Medicare claims; addition to the list of telehealth services; and, several coding issues. We are making these changes to ensure that our payment systems are updated to reflect changes in medical practice and the relative value of services. This final rule also addresses the following provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-17) (MMA): coverage of an initial preventive physical examination; coverage of cardiovascular (CV) screening blood tests; coverage of diabetes screening tests; incentive payment improvements for physicians in shortage areas; payment for covered outpatient drugs and biologicals; payment for renal dialysis services; coverage of routine costs associated with certain clinical trials of category A devices as defined by the Food and Drug Administration; hospice consultation service; indexing the Part B deductible to inflation; extension of coverage of intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) for the treatment in the home of primary immune deficiency diseases; revisions to reassignment provisions; and, payment for diagnostic mammograms, physicians' services associated with drug administration services and coverage of religious nonmedical health care institution items and services to the beneficiary's home. In addition, this rule updates the codes subject to the physician self-referral prohibition, discusses payment for set-up of portable x- ray equipment, discusses the third five-year refinement of work RVUs, and solicits comments on potentially misvalued work RVUs. We are also finalizing the calendar year (CY) 2004 interim RVUs and are issuing interim RVUs for new and revised procedure codes for CY 2005. As required by the statute, we are announcing that the physician fee schedule update for CY 2005 is 1.5 percent, the initial estimate for the sustainable growth rate for CY 2005 is 4.3, and the conversion factor for CY 2005 is $37.8975.

Medicare Program; Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit
This final rule implements the provisions of the Social Security Act (the Act) establishing and regulating the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit. The new voluntary prescription drug benefit program was enacted into law on December 8, 2003 in section 101 of Title I of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) (Pub. L. 108-173). Although this final rule specifies most of the requirements for implementing the new prescription drug program, readers should note that we are also issuing a closely related rule that concerns Medicare Advantage organizations, which, if they offer coordinated care plans, must offer at least one plan that combines medical coverage under Parts A and B with prescription drug coverage. Readers should also note that separate CMS guidance on many operational details appears or will soon appear on the CMS website, such as materials on formulary review criteria, risk plan and fallback plan solicitations, bid instructions, solvency standards and pricing tools, plan benefit packages. The addition of a prescription drug benefit to Medicare represents a landmark change to the Medicare program that will significantly improve the health care coverage available to millions of Medicare beneficiaries. The MMA specifies that the prescription drug benefit program will become available to beneficiaries beginning on January 1, 2006. Generally, coverage for the prescription drug benefit will be provided under private prescription drug plans (PDPs), which will offer only prescription drug coverage, or through Medicare Advantage prescription drug plans (MA PDs), which will offer prescription drug coverage that is integrated with the health care coverage they provide to Medicare beneficiaries under Part C of Medicare. PDPs must offer a basic prescription drug benefit. MA-PDs must offer either a basic benefit or broader coverage for no additional cost. If this required level of coverage is offered, MA-PDs or PDPs, but not fallback PDPs may also offer supplemental benefits through enhanced alternative coverage for an additional premium. All organizations offering drug plans will have flexibility in the design of the prescription drug benefit. Consistent with the MMA, this final rule also provides for subsidy payments to sponsors of qualified retiree prescription drug plans to encourage retention of employer-sponsored benefits. We are implementing the drug benefit in a way that permits and encourages a range of options for Medicare beneficiaries to augment the standard Medicare coverage. These options include facilitating additional coverage through employer plans, MA-PD plans and high-option PDPs, and through charity organizations and State pharmaceutical assistance programs. See sections II.C, II.J, and II.P, and II.R of this preamble for further details on these issues. The proposed rule identified options and alternatives to the provisions we proposed and we strongly encouraged comments and ideas on our approach and on alternatives to help us design the Medicare Prescription Drug Benefit Program to operate as effectively and efficiently as possible in meeting the needs of Medicare beneficiaries.

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates, Policy Changes, and Clarification
This proposed rule would update the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The payment amounts and factors used to determine the updated Federal rates that are described in this proposed rule have been determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related group (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and would continue to be effective each October 1. The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 is also derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. We are proposing to adopt new labor market area definitions for the purpose of geographic classification and the wage index. We are also proposing policy changes and clarifications.

These changes are necessary to reflect the advances in dialysis technology and standard care practices since the requirements were last revised in their entirety in 1976.

Payment for Non-VA Physician and Other Health Care Professional Services Associated With Either Outpatient or Inpatient Care Provided at Non-VA Facilities
This final rule amends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) medical regulations concerning payment for non-VA health care professional services that are associated with either outpatient or inpatient care provided to eligible VA beneficiaries at non-VA facilities. Currently, the medical regulations require all VA facilities to reimburse for non-VA health care professional services based upon the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) physician fee schedule in effect at the time the services are provided. However, if the standard payment methodology is implemented in Alaska, VA payments will be significantly less than the usual and customary charges for the state. This may limit VA patient access to non-VA health care. Since a large portion of VA health care provided in Alaska is obtained from non-VA sources, this could negatively impact the quality of care provided veterans living in that state. This rule establishes an Alaska-specific payment methodology for inpatient and outpatient non-VA health care professional services within that state. The rule ensures that amounts paid to health care providers represent the local cost to furnish a service, while continuing to achieve program cost reductions.

Rail Fixed Guideway Systems; State Safety Oversight
The Federal Transit Administration is revising its rule on state safety oversight of rail fixed guideway systems not regulated by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Since January 26, 1996, when the rule took effect, the agency has gained experience and insight concerning the benefits of and recommended practices for implementing state safety oversight requirements. This final rule revises the State Safety Oversight rule and adds clarifying sections, further specification concerning what the state must require to monitor safety and security of non-FRA rail systems, and incorporates into the body of the regulation material previously incorporated by reference. The revised part should be easier to understand and ensure greater compliance of the State oversight agencies, and enhance the safety and security of the rail systems governed by this part.

Medicare Program; Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2006 Rates
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth proposed rate-of-increase limits as well as proposed policy changes for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2005, with one exception: The proposed changes relating to submittal of hospital wage data by a campus or campuses of a multicampus hospital system (that is, the proposed changes to Sec. 412.230(d)(2) of the regulations) would be effective upon publication of the final rule. Among the policy changes that we are proposing to make are changes relating to: the classification of cases to the diagnosis-related groups (DRGs); the long-term care (LTC)-DRGs and relative weights; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; rebasing and revision of the hospital market basket; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; policies governing postacute care transfers, payments to hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education, submission of hospital quality data, payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals, changes in the requirements for provider-based facilities; and changes in the requirements for critical access hospitals (CAHs).

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals: Annual Payment Rate Updates, Policy Changes, and Clarification
This final rule updates the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The payment amounts and factors used to determine the updated Federal rates that are described in this final rule have been determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related group (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and will continue to be effective each October 1. The outlier threshold for July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 is also derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. We are adopting new labor market area definitions for the purpose of geographic classification and the wage index. We are also making policy changes and clarifications.

The OCC, Board, FDIC, OTS, and NCUA (Agencies) are publishing interim final rules to implement section 411 of the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act). The interim final rules create exceptions to the statute's general prohibition on creditors obtaining or using medical information pertaining to a consumer in connection with any determination of the consumer's eligibility, or continued eligibility, for credit for all creditors. The exceptions permit creditors to obtain or use medical information in connection with credit eligibility determinations where necessary and appropriate for legitimate purposes, consistent with the Congressional intent to restrict the use of medical information for inappropriate purposes. The interim final rules also create limited exceptions to permit affiliates to share medical information with each other without becoming consumer reporting agencies.

Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, As Amended
The Veterans' Employment and Training Service (``VETS'' or ``the Agency'') issued proposed rules implementing the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended (USERRA). This document sets forth the Agency's review of and response to comments on the proposal and any changes made in response to those comments. Congress enacted USERRA to protect the rights of persons who voluntarily or involuntarily leave employment positions to undertake military service. USERRA authorizes the Secretary of Labor (in consultation with the Secretary of Defense) to prescribe rules implementing the law as it applies to States, local governments, and private employers. VETS proposed rules under that authority in order to provide guidance to employers and employees concerning their rights and obligations under USERRA. The Agency invited written comments on these proposed rules, and any specific issues related to the proposal, from members of the public.

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals RY 2007: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates, Policy Changes, and Clarification
This proposed rule would update the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The proposed payment amounts and factors used to determine the updated Federal rates that are described in this proposed rule were determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007. The annual update of the long-term care diagnosis-related group (LTC-DRG) classifications and relative weights remains linked to the annual adjustments of the acute care hospital inpatient diagnosis-related group system, and would continue to be effective each October 1. The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2006, through June 30, 2007, would also be derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. We are also proposing to make policy changes and clarifications.

The Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, along with certain additional provisions in the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, was designed to protect program beneficiaries from unfit health care practitioners, and otherwise improve the anti-fraud provisions of the Medicare and State health care programs. Section 1921, the statutory authority upon which this regulatory action is based, requires each State to adopt a system of reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) certain adverse licensure actions taken against health care practitioners and health care entities licensed or otherwise authorized by a State (or a political subdivision thereof) to provide health care services. It also requires each State to report any negative actions or findings that a State licensing authority, peer review organization, or private accreditation entity has concluded against a health care practitioner or health care entity.

Medicare Program; Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2007 Rates
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement a number of changes made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171). In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth proposed rate-of-increase limits as well as proposed policy changes for hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2006. In this proposed rule, we discuss our proposals to refine the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system under the IPPS to better recognize severity of illness among patients--for FY 2007, we are proposing to use a hospital-specific relative value cost center weighting methodology to adjust DRG relative weights and in FY 2008 (if not earlier), to implement consolidated severity-adjusted DRGs or alternative severity adjustment methods. Among the other policy changes that we are proposing to make are changes related to: limited revisions of the reclassification of cases to DRGs; the long-term care (LTC)-DRGs and relative weights; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; payments to hospitals for the direct and indirect costs of graduate medical education; submission of hospital quality data; payments to sole community hospitals and Medicare-dependent, small rural hospitals; and provisions governing emergency services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). We are also inviting comments on a number of issues including performance-based hospital payments for services and health information technology, as well as how to improve data transparency for consumers.

This proposed rule would implement competitive bidding programs for certain covered items of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics, and supplies (DMEPOS) throughout the United States in accordance with sections 1847(a) and (b) of the Social Security Act (the Act). These programs would change the way that Medicare pays for these items under Part B of the Medicare program by utilizing bids submitted by DMEPOS suppliers to establish applicable payment amounts. We would phase in these programs over several years. This proposed rule would also detail requirements for CMS approved accreditation organizations that will be applying quality standards for all DMEPOS suppliers, including DMEPOS suppliers that participate in the DMEPOS competitive bidding program. In addition, this rule proposes a new fee schedule for home dialysis supplies and equipment still paid on a reasonable charge basis. This proposed rule would also clarify our policy on the scope of the statutory eyeglass coverage exclusion. We are proposing to specify in regulations that the eyeglass exclusion encompasses all devices that use lenses to aid vision or provide magnification of images for impaired vision. Further, this proposed rule would implement a revised methodology for calculating fee schedule amounts for new DMEPOS items.

We are responding to requested public comments on a number of other issues that include performance-based hospital payments for services and health information technology, as well as how to improve health data transparency for consumers. In addition, we are responding to public comments received on a proposed rule issued in the Federal Register on May 17, 2006 that proposed to revise the methodology for calculating the occupational mix adjustment to the wage index for the FY 2007 hospital inpatient prospective payment system by applying an adjustment to 100 percent of the wage index using new 2006 occupational mix survey data collected from hospitals.

Medicare Program; Hospital Outpatient Prospective Payment System and CY 2007 Payment Rates; CY 2007 Update to the Ambulatory Surgical Center Covered Procedures List; Ambulatory Surgical Center Payment System and CY 2008 Payment Rates; Medicare Administrative Contractors; and Reporting Hospital Quality Data for FY 2008 Inpatient Prospective Payment System Annual Payment Update Program-HCAHPS® Survey, SCIP, and Mortality
This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system, and to implement certain related provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003, and the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. The proposed rule describes proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. In addition, this proposed rule would revise the current list of procedures that are approved when furnished in a Medicare-approved ambulatory surgical center (ASC), which would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2007. Further, this proposed rule would revise the ASC facility payment system to implement provisions of the MMA and other applicable statutory requirements, and update the ASC payment rates. Changes to the ASC facility payment system and the payment rates would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. This proposed rule would revise the emergency medical screening requirements for critical access hospitals (CAHs). In addition, this proposed rule would support implementation of a restructuring of the contracting entities responsibilities and functions that support the adjudication of Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) claims. This restructuring is directed by section 1874A of the Act, as added by section 911 of the MMA. The prior separate Medicare intermediary and Medicare carrier contracting authorities under Title XVIII of the Act have been replaced with the Medicare Administrative Contractor (MAC) authority. This proposed rule would also continue to implement the requirements of the DRA that require that we expand the ``starter set'' of 10 quality measures that we used in FY 2005 and FY 2006 for the hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS) Reporting Hospital Quality Data for the Annual Payment Update (RHQDAPU) program. We began to adopt expanded measures effective for payments beginning in FY 2007. We are proposing to add additional quality measures to the expanded set of measures for FY 2008 payment purposes. These measures include the HCAHPS[supreg] survey, as well as Surgical Care Improvement Project (SCIP, formerly Surgical Infection Prevention (SIP)), and Mortality quality measures.

Medicaid Program and State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) Payment Error Rate Measurement
This interim final rule with comment period sets forth the State requirements to provide information to us for purposes of estimating improper payments in Medicaid and SCHIP. The Improper Payments Information Act of 2002 (IPIA) requires heads of Federal agencies to estimate and report to the Congress annually these estimates of improper payments for the programs they oversee, and submit a report on actions the agency is taking to reduce erroneous payments. This interim final rule with comment responds to the public comments on the October 5, 2005 interim final rule and sets forth State requirements for submitting claims and policies to the Federal contractor for purposes of conducting FFS and managed care reviews. This interim final rule also sets forth and invites further comments on the State requirements for conducting eligibility reviews and estimating payment error rates due to errors in eligibility determinations.

Requirements for Foreign and Domestic Establishment Registration and Listing for Human Drugs, Including Drugs that are Regulated Under a Biologics License Application, and Animal Drugs
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is proposing to amend its regulations governing drug establishment registration and drug listing. The proposed revisions would reorganize, consolidate, clarify, and modify current regulations concerning who must register establishments and list human drugs, human drugs that are also biological products (including vaccines and allergenic products), and/ or human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products (HCT/ Ps), and animal drugs. The proposal describes when and how to register and list and what information must be submitted for registration and listing. In addition, the proposal would make certain changes to the National Drug Code (NDC) system and would require the appropriate NDC number to appear on the labels for drugs subject to the listing requirements. The proposed regulations generally would require the electronic submission of all registration and most listing information. We (FDA) rely on establishment registration and drug listing information for administering many of our programs, such as postmarketing surveillance (including FDA inspections), bioterrorism, drug shortages and availability, and user fee assessments. We are taking this action to use the latest technology to improve our registration and listing system, which would further our goal of protecting the public health. We also believe that the conversion to an electronic system would make the registration and listing processes more efficient and effective for industry and us. We are also taking this action to support the implementation of, for example, the electronic prescribing provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act, our rulemaking requiring a bar code on certain drug products, and the DailyMed initiative.

Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children (WIC): Miscellaneous Provisions
This final rule amends a number of existing provisions in the WIC Program regulations to address issues raised by WIC State agencies, other members of the WIC community, and the United States Government Accountability Office (GAO). This final rule also incorporates recent legislation and certain longstanding program policies and State agency practices into the regulations. Further, the final rule also streamlines certain requirements in the regulations. In particular, this rulemaking streamlines the Federal requirements for financial and participation reporting by State agencies, and clarifies the requirements pertaining to the confidentiality of WIC information in order to strengthen coordination with public organizations and private physicians. It also incorporates recent legislation which provided the WIC State agencies with the option to extend the certification period for breastfeeding women. Further, it incorporates longstanding program policies and State agency practices into the regulations regarding State agency responses to subpoenas and other court-ordered requests for confidential information. Other provisions in this final rule are designed to improve eligibility determinations, incorporating program policies and State agency practices that have been in effect for some time. These changes are intended to reinforce program policies and State agency practices that strengthen services to WIC participants, improve Program administration, and increase State agency flexibility in managing the Program. Many of these provisions are options the State agency may choose to implement in operating the program.

Request for Information on the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
This notice requests comments related to the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (the ``FMLA'' or the ``Act''). The Employment Standards Administration, Wage and Hour Division, of the Department of Labor (the ``Department'') seeks information for its consideration and review of the Department's administration of the Act and implementing regulations. The Department held stakeholder meetings regarding the FMLA with more than 20 groups from December 2002-February 2003. Many of the subject matter areas in this request are derived from comments at those stakeholder meetings and also from (1) rulings of the Supreme Court of the United States and other federal courts over the past twelve years; (2) the Department's experience in administering the law; and (3) public input presented in numerous Congressional hearings and public comments filed with the Office of Management and Budget (``OMB'') in connection with three annual reports to Congress regarding the Costs and Benefits of Federal regulations in 2001, 2002, 2004. In addition, the Department has reviewed numerous source materials about issues associated with the FMLA. During this process, the Department has heard a variety of concerns expressed about the FMLA. Some of those concerns, however, are beyond the Department's statutory authority to address. Some are not. In this regard, the Department invites interested parties having knowledge of, or experience with, the FMLA to submit comments and welcomes any pertinent information that will provide a basis for ascertaining the effectiveness of the current implementing regulations and the Department's administration of the Act. The questions posed are not meant to be an exclusive list of issues for which the Department seeks commentary and information.

Telemarketing Sales Rule; Extension Beyond January 2, 2007, of the Previously Announced Forbearance Policy in Enforcement of the Prohibition of Prerecorded Calls in the Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”)

The Commission accordingly also announced the revocation of a previously announced policy of forbearing from enforcement of the TSR's call abandonment prohibition effective January 2, 2007. In response to a request for an extension of the forbearance policy, the Commission has determined that the forbearance policy should remain in effect until the conclusion of the prerecorded call amendment proceeding.

Electronic On-Board Recorders for Hours-of-Service Compliance
The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) proposes to amend the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations (FMCSRs) to incorporate new performance standards for electronic on-board recorders (EOBRs) installed in commercial motor vehicles (CMVs) manufactured on or after the date 2 years following the effective date of a final rule. On-board hours-of-service recording devices meeting FMCSA's current requirements and voluntarily installed in CMVs manufactured before the implementation date of a final rule may continue to be used for the remainder of the service life of those CMVs. Under the proposal, motor carriers that have demonstrated a history of serious noncompliance with the hours-of-service (HOS) rules would be subject to mandatory installation of EOBRs meeting the new performance standards. If FMCSA determined, based on HOS records reviewed during each of two compliance reviews conducted within a 2- year period, that a motor carrier had a 10 percent or greater violation rate (``pattern violation'') for any regulation in proposed Appendix C to Part 385, FMCSA would issue the carrier an EOBR remedial directive. The motor carrier would be required to install EOBRs in all of its CMVs regardless of their date of manufacture and to use the devices for HOS recordkeeping for a period of 2 years, unless the carrier already had equipped its vehicles with automatic on-board recording devices (AOBRDs) meeting the Agency's current requirements under 49 CFR 395.15 and could demonstrate to FMCSA that its drivers understand how to use the devices. We also propose changes to the safety fitness standard that would require this group of carriers to install, use, and maintain EOBRs in order to meet the new standard. Finally, FMCSA would encourage industrywide use of EOBRs by providing the following incentives for motor carriers to voluntarily use EOBRs in their CMVs: Revising the Agency's compliance review procedures to permit examination of a random sample of drivers' records of duty status; providing partial relief from HOS supporting documents requirements, if certain conditions are satisfied; and other potential incentives made possible by the inherent safety and driver health benefits of EOBR technology.

Medicare Program; Prospective Payment System for Long-Term Care Hospitals RY 2008: Proposed Annual Payment Rate Updates, and Policy Changes; and Proposed Hospital Direct and Indirect Graduate Medical Education Policy Changes
This proposed rule would update the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). The proposed payment amounts and factors used to determine the updated Federal rates that are described in this proposed rule were determined based on the LTCH PPS rate year July 1, 2007 through June 30, 2008.

The proposed outlier threshold for July 1, 2007, through June 30, 2008, would also be derived from the LTCH PPS rate year calculations. We are also proposing to make policy changes which include proposed revisions to the GME and IME policies. In addition, we are adding a technical amendment correcting the regulations text at Sec. 412.22.

Medicare Program; Proposed Changes to the Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems and Fiscal Year 2008 Rates
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement certain provisions made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (Pub. L. 109-171), the Medicare Improvements and Extension Act under Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (Pub. L. 109-432), and the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (Pub. L. 109-417). In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth proposed rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid in full or in part on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits or that have a portion of a prospective payment system payment based on reasonable cost principles. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2007. In this proposed rule, we discuss our proposals to further refine the diagnosis-related group (DRG) system under the IPPS to better recognize severity of illness among patients--for FY 2008, we are proposing to adopt a Medicare Severity DRG (MS-DRG) classification system for the IPPS. We are also proposing to use the structure of the proposed MS-DRG system for the LTCH prospective payment system (referred to as MS-LTC-DRGs) for FY 2008. Among the other policy changes that we are proposing to make are changes related to: Limited revisions of the reclassification of cases to proposed MS-DRGs, the proposed relative weights for the proposed MS- LTC-DRGs; the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the wage index; applications for new technologies and medical services add-on payments; payments to hospitals for the indirect costs of graduate medical education; submission of hospital quality data; provisions governing application of sanctions relating to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA); provisions governing disclosure of physician ownership in hospitals and patient safety measures; and provisions relating to services furnished to beneficiaries in custody of penal authorities.

Medicare Program; Surety Bond Requirement for Suppliers of Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS)
Consistent with section 4312(a) of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA), this proposed rule implements section 1834(a)(16)(B) of the Social Security Act (the Act) by requiring all Medicare suppliers of durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (DMEPOS) to furnish CMS with a surety bond. We believe that this requirement would limit the Medicare program risk to fraudulent DME suppliers; enhance the Medicare enrollment process to help ensure that only legitimate DME suppliers are enrolled or are allowed to remain enrolled in the Medicare program; ensure that the Medicare program recoups erroneous payments that result from fraudulent or abusive billing practices by allowing CMS or its designated contractor to seek payments from a Surety up to the penal sum; and help ensure that Medicare beneficiaries receive products and services that are considered reasonable and necessary from legitimate DME suppliers.

This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with this system. In this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the payment rates for Medicare hospital outpatient services paid under the prospective payment system. These changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. In addition, this proposed rule would update the revised Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system to implement certain related provisions of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA). In this proposed rule, we propose the applicable relative payment weights and amounts for services furnished in ASCs, specific HCPCS codes to which the final policies of the ASC payment system would apply, and other pertinent ratesetting information for the CY 2008 ASC payment system. These changes would be applicable to services furnished on or after January 1, 2008. In this proposed rule, we also are proposing changes to the policies relating to the necessary provider designations of critical access hospitals (CAHs) that are being recertified when a CAH enters into a new co-location arrangement with another hospital or CAH or when the CAH creates or acquires an off-campus location. Further, we are proposing changes to several of the current conditions of participation that hospitals must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs to require the completion and documentation in the medical record of medical histories and physical examinations of patients conducted after admission and prior to surgery or a procedure requiring anesthesia services and for postanesthesia evaluations of patients before discharge or transfer from the postanesthesia recovery area.

Medicare Program; Proposed Standards for E-Prescribing Under Medicare Part D
This rule proposes the adoption of final uniform standards for an electronic prescription drug program as required by section 1860D- 4(e)(4)(D) of the Social Security Act (the Act). It also proposes the adoption of a standard identifier for providers and dispensers for use in e-prescribing transactions under sections 1860D-4(e)(3) and 1860D- 4(e)(4)(C)(ii), and section 1102 of the Social Security Act. The standards proposed under section 1860D-4(e)(4)(D) have been pilot tested and evaluated, and the findings indicate that the proposed standards meet the requirements for final standards that can be used for the Medicare Part D e-prescribing programs. The standards proposed in this rule, in addition to the foundation standards that were already adopted as final standards (see 70 FR 67568), represent an ongoing approach to adopting standards that are consistent with the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) objectives of patient safety, quality of care, and efficiencies and cost saving in the delivery of care.

This proposed rule would provide requirements for an eligible entity to enter into a contract under the Medicaid integrity audit program. The proposed rule would also establish the contracting requirements for eligible entities. The requirements would include procedures for identifying, evaluating, and resolving organizational conflicts of interest that are generally applicable to Federal acquisition and procurement; competitive procedures to be used; and procedures under which a contract may be renewed.

Revisions to Procedures for the Departmental Appeals Board and Other Departmental Hearings
The Department of Health and Human Services (Department) proposes to amend Departmental regulations governing administrative review by the Departmental Appeals Board (DAB) and certain other administrative review regulations to ensure that the final administrative decision of the Department reflects the considered opinion of the Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary). Current regulations at 45 CFR Part 16 governing the review of grant disputes do not specifically require the DAB to follow published guidance issued by the Secretary or a Departmental component. The DAB decision is currently the final administrative decision of the Department on such disputes and currently there is no Secretarial review of this final decision. Similarly, the DAB currently provides the final agency review of the imposition of civil monetary penalties (CMPs) for which administrative appeal is available under 45 CFR Part 160, Subpart E, enforcement sanctions under 42 CFR Part 422 and 423, determinations subject to reconsideration and appeal under 42 CFR Part 498 and the imposition by the Inspector General of the Department (I.G.) or the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) of exclusions, CMPs and assessments subject to appeal under 42 CFR Part 1005. As in 45 CFR Part 16, the decisions of the DAB under these processes are considered the final agency action on matters, though they are not subject to Secretarial review. This proposed rule would amend DAB regulations to require that the DAB follow published guidance that is not inconsistent with applicable statutes and regulations and would permit the Secretary an opportunity to review DAB decisions to correct errors in the application of law, or deviations from published guidance, in such disputes. This proposed rule would make technical changes to the regulations at 45 CFR Part 16. This proposed rule would also amend hearing and appeal procedures at 45 CFR Part 160, Subpart E and at 42 CFR Parts 422, 423 and 498 to include a parallel statement regarding the treatment of published guidance. Similarly, this proposed rule would amend the procedures at 45 CFR Part 81 to provide a similar statement regarding the treatment of published guidance by hearing examiners and reviewing authorities. In addition, this proposed rule would amend the hearing and appeal procedures at 45 CFR Part 160, Subpart E and 42 CFR Parts 422, 423, 498 and 1005 to provide a parallel opportunity for Secretarial review of DAB decisions. Finally, this proposed rule would revise the procedures for Head Start grantee appeals by applying the current 60-day time limit for ``final decisions'' to the Board's decision.

The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
The Department of Labor's Employment Standards Administration/ Wage and Hour Division proposes to revise certain regulations implementing the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (``FMLA''), the law that provides eligible workers with important rights to job protection for absences due to the birth or adoption of a child or for a serious health condition of the worker or a qualifying family member. The proposed changes are based on the Department's experience of nearly fifteen years administering the law, two previous Department of Labor studies of the FMLA in 1996 and 2001, several U.S. Supreme Court and lower court rulings, and the public comments received in response to a Request for Information (``RFI'') published in the Federal Register in December 2006 requesting information about experiences with the FMLA and comments on the effectiveness of these regulations. The Department is also seeking public comment on issues to be addressed in final regulations regarding military family leave. Section 585(a) of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2008 amends the FMLA to provide leave to eligible employees of covered employers to care for injured servicemembers and because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a covered family member is on active duty or has been notified of an impending call to active duty status in support of a contingency operation (collectively referred to herein as military family leave). The provisions of this amendment providing FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember became effective on January 28, 2008, when the law was enacted. The provisions of this amendment providing for FMLA leave due to a qualifying exigency arising out of a covered family member's active duty (or call to active duty) status are not effective until the Secretary of Labor issues regulations defining ``qualifying exigencies.'' Because of the need to issue regulations under the military family leave provisions of the amendment as soon as possible, the Department is including in this Notice a description of the relevant military family leave statutory provisions, a discussion of issues the Department has identified, and a series of questions seeking comment on subjects and issues that may be considered in the final regulations.

The proposed regulations establish a framework by which hospitals, doctors, and other health care providers may voluntarily report information to Patient Safety Organizations (PSOs), on a privileged and confidential basis, for analysis of patient safety events. The proposed regulations also outline the requirements that entities must meet to become PSOs and the processes for the Secretary to review and accept certifications and to list PSOs. In addition, the proposed regulation establishes the confidentiality protections for the information that is assembled and developed by providers and PSOs, termed ``patient safety work product'' by the Patient Safety Act, and the procedures for the imposition of civil money penalties for the knowing or reckless impermissible disclosure of patient safety work product.

These proposed regulations are needed to implement amendments to FERPA contained in the USA Patriot Act and the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, to implement two U.S. Supreme Court decisions interpreting FERPA, and to make necessary changes identified as a result of the Department's experience administering FERPA and current regulations. These changes would clarify permissible disclosures to parents of eligible students and conditions that apply to disclosures in health and safety emergencies; clarify permissible disclosures of student identifiers as directory information; allow disclosures to contractors and other outside parties in connection with the outsourcing of institutional services and functions; revise the definitions of attendance, disclosure, education records, personally identifiable information, and other key terms; clarify permissible redisclosures by State and Federal officials; and update investigation and enforcement provisions.

We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement certain provisions made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the Medicare Improvements and Extension Act, Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, and the TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007. In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008. We also are setting forth the proposed update to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2008. Among the other policy decisions and changes that we are proposing to make are changes related to: Limited proposed revisions of the classification of cases to Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups (MS-DRGs), proposals to address charge compression issues in the calculation of MS-DRG relative weights, the proposed revisions to the classifications and relative weights for the Medicare severity long- term care diagnosis-related groups (MS-LTC-DRGs); applications for new medical services and technologies add-on payments; wage index reform changes and the wage data, including the occupational mix data, used to compute the proposed FY 2009 wage indices; submission of hospital quality data; proposed changes to the postacute care transfer policy relating to transfers to home for the furnishing of home health services; and proposed policy changes relating to the requirements for furnishing hospital emergency services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). In addition, we are proposing policy changes relating to disclosure to patients of physician ownership or investment interests in hospitals and soliciting public comments on a proposed collection of information regarding financial relationships between hospitals and physicians. We are also proposing changes or soliciting comments on issues relating to policies on physician self-referrals.

DEA is proposing to revise its regulations to provide practitioners with the option of writing prescriptions for controlled substances electronically. These regulations would also permit pharmacies to receive, dispense, and archive these electronic prescriptions. These proposed regulations would be an addition to, not a replacement of, the existing rules. These regulations provide pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners with the ability to use modern technology for controlled substance prescriptions while maintaining the closed system of controls on controlled substances dispensing; additionally, the proposed regulations would reduce paperwork for DEA registrants who dispense or prescribe controlled substances and have the potential to reduce prescription forgery. The proposed regulations would also have the potential to reduce the number of prescription errors caused by illegible handwriting and misunderstood oral prescriptions. Moreover, they would help both pharmacies and hospitals to integrate prescription records into other medical records more directly, which would increase efficiency, and would reduce the amount of time patients spend waiting to have their prescriptions filled.

We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems, and to implement certain provisions made by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the Medicare Improvements and Extension Act, Division B, Title I of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, the TMA, Abstinence Education, and QI Programs Extension Act of 2007, and the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008. In addition, in the Addendum to this final rule, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. These changes are generally applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008. We also are setting forth the update to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals and hospital units excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2008. In addition to the changes for hospitals paid under the IPPS, this document contains revisions to the patient classifications and relative weights used under the long-term care hospital prospective payment system (LTCH PPS). This document also contains policy changes relating to the requirements for furnishing hospital emergency services under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act of 1986 (EMTALA). In this document, we are responding to public comments and finalizing the policies contained in two interim final rules relating to payments for Medicare graduate medical education to affiliated teaching hospitals in certain emergency situations. We are revising the regulatory requirements relating to disclosure to patients of physician ownership or investment interests in hospitals and responding to public comments on a collection of information regarding financial relationships between hospitals and physicians. In addition, we are responding to public comments on proposals made in two separate rulemakings related to policies on physician self-referrals and finalizing these policies.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Modification to Medical Data Code Set Standards To Adopt ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS
This proposed rule would modify two of the medical data code set standards adopted in the Transactions and Code Sets final rule published in the Federal Register. It would also implement certain provisions of the Administrative Simplification subtitle of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) of 1996. Specifically, the proposed rule would modify the standard code sets for coding diagnoses and inpatient hospital procedures by concurrently adopting the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for diagnosis coding, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) for inpatient hospital procedure coding. These new codes would replace the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) Volumes 1 and 2, and the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (CM) Volume 3 for diagnosis and procedure codes, respectively.

Telemarketing Sales Rule (“TSR”)
The Commission adopts two final amendments to the TSR. The first is an amendment making explicit a prohibition in the TSR on telemarketing calls that deliver prerecorded messages without a consumer's express written agreement to receive such calls. This amendment also requires that all prerecorded telemarketing calls provide specified opt-out mechanisms so that consumers can opt out of future calls. The amendment is necessary because the reasonable consumer would consider prerecorded telemarketing messages to be coercive or abusive of such consumer's right to privacy. The second amendment modifies the method for measuring the maximum call abandonment rate prescribed by the TSR's call abandonment safe harbor. The new method will permit sellers and telemarketers to calculate call abandonment rates for a live calling campaign over a thirty-day period, or any part thereof. This amendment is necessary because the current ``per day'' standard effectively precludes the use of predictive dialers with small calling lists.

Labor Organization Annual Financial Reports for Trusts in Which a Labor Organization Is Interested, Form T-1
The Employment Standards Administration (ESA) Office of Labor- Management Standards (OLMS) of the Department of Labor publishes this final rule to establish a form to be used by labor organizations to file trust annual financial reports (Form T-1) and to provide appropriate instructions and revise relevant portions of 29 CFR Part 43 relating to such reports. On March 4, 2008, the Department published a notice of proposed rulemaking setting forth the Department's Form T-1 proposal. Under the proposal, certain labor organizations would file annual reports about certain trusts to which they contributed money or otherwise provided financial assistance or over which they exercised managerial control. This document sets forth the Department's review of and response to comments on the proposal. This final rule requires that a labor organization with total annual receipts of $250,000 or more file a Form T-1 for each trust of the type defined by section 3(l) of the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) and that meets one of the two following filing triggers: The labor organization, alone or with other labor organizations, either: Appoints or selects a majority of the members of the trust's governing board; or makes contributions to the trust that exceed 50 percent of the trust's receipts during the trust's fiscal year. This final rule provides five exemptions to the Form T-1 filing requirements: A political action committee (PAC) fund, if publicly available reports on the PAC fund are filed with federal or state agencies; any political organization for which reports are filed with the IRS under section 527 of the IRS code; trusts required to file a Form 5500 under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA); federal employee health benefit plans that are subject to the provisions of the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act (FEHBA); and any trust for which an independent audit has been conducted, in accordance with the standards set forth in this final rule. This final rule will apply prospectively.

Amendment to the Universal Waste Rule: Addition of Pharmaceuticals
EPA is proposing to add hazardous pharmaceutical wastes to the Universal Waste Rule. The Universal Waste Rule, originally promulgated on May 11, 1995, modified the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act's hazardous waste regulations by establishing a set of streamlined requirements for the collection of certain widely dispersed hazardous wastes, called ``universal wastes.'' This proposed rule would facilitate better management of pharmaceutical wastes by streamlining the generator requirements and encouraging generators of hazardous pharmaceutical wastes to manage them under the provisions of the Universal Waste Rule, which ensures that these hazardous pharmaceutical wastes are properly disposed of and treated as hazardous wastes. In addition, this proposed rule would facilitate the implementation of pharmaceutical take-back programs by removing RCRA barriers in the collection of pharmaceutical wastes from health care and other such regulated facilities, as well as facilitate the collection of pharmaceutical wastes from households, including non-hazardous pharmaceutical wastes.

The Secretary amends our regulations implementing the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which is section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act. These amendments are needed to implement a provision of the USA Patriot Act and the Campus Sex Crimes Prevention Act, which added new exceptions permitting the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records without consent. The amendments also implement two U.S. Supreme Court decisions interpreting FERPA, and make necessary changes identified as a result of the Department's experience administering FERPA and the current regulations. These changes clarify permissible disclosures to parents of eligible students and conditions that apply to disclosures in health and safety emergencies; clarify permissible disclosures of student identifiers as directory information; allow disclosures to contractors and other outside parties in connection with the outsourcing of institutional services and functions; revise the definitions of attendance, disclosure, education records, personally identifiable information, and other key terms; clarify permissible redisclosures by State and Federal officials; and update investigation and enforcement provisions.

The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a final rule to ensure that Department funds do not support morally coercive or discriminatory practices or policies in violation of federal law, pursuant to the Church Amendments (42 U.S.C. 300a-7), Public Health Service (PHS) Act Sec. 245 (42 U.S.C. 238n), and the Weldon Amendment (Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, Public Law 110-161, Div. G, Sec. 508(d), 121 Stat. 1844, 2209). This final rule defines certain key terms. In order to ensure that recipients of Department funds know about their legal obligations under these federal health care conscience protection laws, the Department is requiring written certification by certain recipients that they will comply with all three statutes, as applicable. Finally, this final rule assigns responsibility for complaint handling and investigation among the Department's Office for Civil Rights and Department program offices.

The HITECH Act (the Act) at section 13402 requires the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to issue interim final regulations within 180 days of enactment to require covered entities under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and their business associates to provide for notification in the case of breaches of unsecured protected health information. For purposes of these requirements, section 13402(h) of the Act defines ``unsecured protected health information'' to mean protected health information that is not secured through the use of a technology or methodology specified by the Secretary in guidance, and requires the Secretary to issue such guidance no later than 60 days after enactment and to specify within the technologies and methodologies that render protected health information unusable, unreadable, or indecipherable to unauthorized individuals. Through this document, HHS is issuing the required guidance and seeking public comment both on the guidance as well as the breach notification provisions of the Act generally to inform the future rulemaking and updates to the guidance.

HIPAA Administrative Simplification: Enforcement
The Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) adopts this interim final rule to conform the enforcement regulations promulgated under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) to the effective statutory revisions made pursuant to the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the HITECH Act), which was enacted as part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). More specifically, this interim final rule amends HIPAA's enforcement regulations, as they relate to the imposition of civil money penalties, to incorporate the HITECH Act's categories of violations, tiered ranges of civil money penalty amounts, and revised limitations on the Secretary's authority to impose civil money penalties for established violations of HIPAA's Administrative Simplification rules (HIPAA rules). This interim final rule does not make amendments with respect to those enforcement provisions of the HITECH Act that are not yet effective under the applicable statutory provisions. Such amendments will be subject to forthcoming rulemaking(s).

This rule also updates the wage index used under the HH PPS. In addition, this rule changes the HH PPS outlier policy, requires the submission of OASIS data as a condition for payment under the HH PPS, implements a revised Outcome and Assessment Information Set (OASIS-C) for episodes beginning on or after January 1, 2010, and implements a Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) Home Health Care Survey (HHCAHPS) affecting payment to HHAs beginning in CY 2012. Also, this rule makes payment safeguards that will improve our enrollment process, improve the quality of care that Medicare beneficiaries receive from HHAs, and reduce the Medicare program's vulnerability to fraud. This rule also adds clarifying language to the ``skilled services'' section and Conditions of Participation (CoP) section of our regulations. This rule also clarifies the coverage of routine medical supplies under the HH PPS.

Regulation of Off-Exchange Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions and Intermediaries
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing to adopt a comprehensive regulatory scheme (``Proposal'') to implement the CFTC Reauthorization Act of 2008 (``CRA'') \1\ with respect to off-exchange transactions in foreign currency with members of the retail public (i.e., ``retail forex transactions''). The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended by the CRA, generally provides that the Commission's jurisdiction extends to contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract) or an option (other than an option executed or traded on a national securities exchange), and to certain leveraged or margined contracts in foreign currency that are offered to or entered into with retail customers. The Commission is proposing a scheme that would put in place requirements for, among other things, registration, disclosure, recordkeeping, financial reporting, minimum capital, and other operational standards, based on both the CFTC's existing regulations for commodity interest transactions and commodity interest intermediaries, as well as rules of the National Futures Association (``NFA'') that are already existing with respect to retail forex transactions offered by NFA's members. Additionally, the Proposal would amend existing regulations as needed to clarify their application to, and inclusion in, the new regulatory scheme for retail forex. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

National Practitioner Data Bank for Adverse Information on Physicians and Other Health Care Practitioners: Reporting on Adverse and Negative Actions
This final rule revises existing regulations under sections 401 through 432 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986, governing the National Practitioner Data Bank for Adverse Information on Physicians and Other Health Care Practitioners, to incorporate statutory requirements under section 1921 of the Social Security Act, as amended by section 5(b) of the Medicare and Medicaid Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987 (MMPPPA), and as amended by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 (OBRA). The MMPPPA, along with certain additional provisions in the OBRA, was designed to protect program beneficiaries from unfit health care practitioners, and otherwise improve the anti-fraud provisions of Medicare and State health care programs. Section 1921, the statutory authority upon which this regulatory action is based, requires each State to adopt a system of reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) certain adverse licensure actions taken against health care practitioners and health care entities licensed or otherwise authorized by a State (or a political subdivision thereof) to provide health care services. It also requires each State to report any negative actions or findings that a State licensing authority, peer review organization, or private accreditation entity has concluded against a health care practitioner or health care entity.

Electronic Prescriptions for Controlled Substances
The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) is revising its regulations to provide practitioners with the option of writing prescriptions for controlled substances electronically. The regulations will also permit pharmacies to receive, dispense, and archive these electronic prescriptions. These regulations are in addition to, not a replacement of, the existing rules. The regulations provide pharmacies, hospitals, and practitioners with the ability to use modern technology for controlled substance prescriptions while maintaining the closed system of controls on controlled substances dispensing; additionally, the regulations will reduce paperwork for DEA registrants who dispense controlled substances and have the potential to reduce prescription forgery. The regulations will also have the potential to reduce the number of prescription errors caused by illegible handwriting and misunderstood oral prescriptions. Moreover, they will help both pharmacies and hospitals to integrate prescription records into other medical records more directly, which may increase efficiency, and potentially reduce the amount of time patients spend waiting to have their prescriptions filled.

We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. In addition, in the Addendum to this proposed rule, we describe the proposed changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare acute care hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2010. We also are setting forth the proposed update to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2010. We are proposing to update the payment policy and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs). In the Addendum to this proposed rule, we also set forth the proposed changes to the payment rates, factors, and other payment rate policies under the LTCH PPS. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2010. We are proposing changes affecting the Medicare conditions of participation for hospitals relating to the types of practitioners who may provide rehabilitation services and respiratory care services. We are proposing changes affecting the determination of the effective date of provider agreements and supplier approvals under Medicare. Finally, we are proposing to offer psychiatric hospitals, hospitals with inpatient psychiatric programs, and psychiatric facilities that are not hospitals increased flexibility in obtaining accreditation to participate in the Medicaid program. Psychiatric hospitals would have the choice of meeting the existing regulatory requirements to participate in Medicare as a psychiatric hospital or to obtaining accreditation from a national accrediting organization whose psychiatric hospital accrediting program has been approved by CMS. Hospitals with inpatient psychiatric programs would have the choice of meeting the existing regulatory requirements for participation in Medicare as a hospital or obtaining accreditation from a national accrediting organization whose hospital accreditation program has been approved by CMS. In addition, psychiatric facilities that are not hospitals would be afforded the flexibility in obtaining accreditation by a national accrediting organization whose program has been approved by CMS, or by any other accrediting organization with comparable standards that is recognized by the State.

Early Retiree Reinsurance Program
This interim final rule with comment period (IFC) implements the Early Retiree Reinsurance Program, which was established by section 1102 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the Affordable Care Act). The Congress appropriated funding of $5 billion for the temporary program. Section 1102(a)(1) requires the Secretary to establish this temporary program not later than 90 days after enactment of the statute, which is June 21, 2010. The program ends no later than January 1, 2014. The program provides reimbursement to participating employment-based plans for a portion of the cost of health benefits for early retirees and their spouses, surviving spouses and dependents. The Secretary will reimburse plans for certain claims between $15,000 and $90,000 (with those amounts being indexed for plan years starting on or after October 1, 2011). The purpose of the reimbursement is to make health benefits more affordable for plan participants and sponsors so that health benefits are accessible to more Americans than they would otherwise be without this program.

This final rule revises the November 25, 2008 final rule entitled, ``Medicaid Programs; Premiums and Cost Sharing (73 FR 71828),'' to address public comments received during reopened comment periods, and to reflect relevant statutory changes made in section 5006(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act). This revised final rule implements and interprets section 1916A of the Social Security Act (the Act), which was added by sections 6041, 6042, and 6043 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA), amended by section 405(a)(1) of the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (TRHCA) and further amended by section 5006(a) of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the Recovery Act). These provisions increase State flexibility to impose premiums and cost sharing for coverage of certain individuals whose family income exceeds specified levels. This revised rule also provides a further opportunity for public comment on revisions made to implement and interpret section 5006(a) of the Recovery Act. The Recovery Act prohibits States from charging premiums and cost sharing under Medicaid to Indians furnished items or services directly by the Indian Health Service, Indian Tribes, Tribal Organizations, or Urban Indian Organizations or through referral under contract health services.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System Changes and FY2011 Rates; Provider Agreements and Supplier Approvals; and Hospital Conditions of Participation for Rehabilitation and Respiratory Care Services; Medicaid Program: Accreditation for Providers of Inpatient Psychiatric Services
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems and to implement certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act and other legislation. In addition, we describe the changes to the amounts and factors used to determine the rates for Medicare acute care hospital inpatient services for operating costs and capital-related costs. We also are setting forth the update to the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. We are updating the payment policy and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and setting forth the changes to the payment rates, factors, and other payment rate policies under the LTCH PPS. In addition, we are finalizing the provisions of the August 27, 2009 interim final rule that implemented statutory provisions relating to payments to LTCHs and LTCH satellite facilities and increases in beds in existing LTCHs and LTCH satellite facilities under the LTCH PPS. We are making changes affecting the: Medicare conditions of participation for hospitals relating to the types of practitioners who may provide rehabilitation services and respiratory care services; and determination of the effective date of provider agreements and supplier approvals under Medicare. We are also setting forth provisions that offer psychiatric hospitals and hospitals with inpatient psychiatric programs increased flexibility in obtaining accreditation to participate in the Medicaid program. Psychiatric hospitals and hospitals with inpatient psychiatric programs will have the choice of undergoing a State survey or of obtaining accreditation from a national accrediting organization whose hospital accreditation program has been approved by CMS. We are also issuing an interim final rule with comment period to implement a provision of the Preservation of Access to Care for Medicare Beneficiaries and Pension Relief Act of 2010 relating to Medicare payments for outpatient services provided prior to a Medicare beneficiary's inpatient admission.

The Act requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register on or before the August 1 that precedes the start of each FY the classification and weighting factors for the IRF prospective payment system (PPS) case-mix groups and a description of the methodology and data used in computing the prospective payment rates for that fiscal year. We are also proposing to consolidate, clarify, and revise existing policies regarding IRF hospitals and IRF units of hospitals to eliminate unnecessary confusion and enhance consistency.

HIPAA Privacy Rule Accounting of Disclosures Under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or ``the Department'') is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule's standard for accounting of disclosures of protected health information. The purpose of these modifications is, in part, to implement the statutory requirement under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (``the HITECH Act'' or ``the Act'') to require covered entities and business associates to account for disclosures of protected health information to carry out treatment, payment, and health care operations if such disclosures are through an electronic health record. Pursuant to both the HITECH Act and its more general authority under HIPAA, the Department proposes to expand the accounting provision to provide individuals with the right to receive an access report indicating who has accessed electronic protected health information in a designated record set. Under its more general authority under HIPAA, the Department also proposes changes to the existing accounting requirements to improve their workability and effectiveness.

Administrative Simplification: Adoption of Operating Rules for Eligibility for a Health Plan and Health Care Claim Status Transactions
Section 1104 of the Administrative Simplification provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (hereafter referred to as the Affordable Care Act) establishes new requirements for administrative transactions that will improve the utility of the existing HIPAA transactions and reduce administrative costs. Specifically, in section 1104(b)(2) of the Affordable Care Act, Congress required the adoption of operating rules for the health care industry and directed the Secretary of Health and Human Services to ``adopt a single set of operating rules for each transaction * * * with the goal of creating as much uniformity in the implementation of the electronic standards as possible.'' This interim final rule with comment period adopts operating rules for two Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) transactions: eligibility for a health plan and health care claim status. This rule also defines the term ``operating rules'' and explains the role of operating rules in relation to the adopted transaction standards. In general, transaction standards adopted under HIPAA enable electronic data interchange through a common interchange structure, thus minimizing the industry's reliance on multiple formats. Operating rules, in turn, attempt to define the rights and responsibilities of all parties, security requirements, transmission formats, response times, liabilities, exception processing, error resolution and more, in order to facilitate successful interoperability between data systems of different entities.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Standards Related to Reinsurance, Risk Corridors and Risk Adjustment
This proposed rule would implement standards for States related to reinsurance and risk adjustment, and for health insurance issuers related to reinsurance, risk corridors, and risk adjustment consistent with title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. These programs will mitigate the impact of potential adverse selection and stabilize premiums in the individual and small group markets as insurance reforms and the Affordable Insurance Exchanges (``Exchanges'') are implemented, starting in 2014. The transitional State-based reinsurance program serves to reduce the uncertainty of insurance risk in the individual market by making payments for high- cost cases. The temporary Federally-administered risk corridor program serves to protect against uncertainty in the Exchange by limiting the extent of issuer losses (and gains). On an ongoing basis, the State- based risk adjustment program is intended to provide adequate payments to health insurance issuers that attract high-risk populations (such as individuals with chronic conditions).

The Office of the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) in coordination with the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) is issuing this advance notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) to request comment on how current regulations for protecting human subjects who participate in research might be modernized and revised to be more effective. This ANPRM seeks comment on how to better protect human subjects who are involved in research, while facilitating valuable research and reducing burden, delay, and ambiguity for investigators. The current regulations governing human subjects research were developed years ago when research was predominantly conducted at universities, colleges, and medical institutions, and each study generally took place at only a single site. Although the regulations have been amended over the years, they have not kept pace with the evolving human research enterprise, the proliferation of multi-site clinical trials and observational studies, the expansion of health services research, research in the social and behavioral sciences, and research involving databases, the Internet, and biological specimen repositories, and the use of advanced technologies, such as genomics. Revisions to the current human subjects regulations are being considered because OSTP and HHS believe these changes would strengthen protections for research subjects.

Medicare Program; Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System for Federal Fiscal Year 2012; Changes in Size and Square Footage of Inpatient Rehabilitation Units and Inpatient Psychiatric Units
This final rule will implement section 3004 of the Affordable Care Act, which establishes a new quality reporting program that provides for a 2 percent reduction in the annual increase factor beginning in 2014 for failure to report quality data to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. This final rule will also update the prospective payment rates for inpatient rehabilitation facilities (IRFs) for Federal fiscal year (FY) 2012 (for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2011 and on or before September 30, 2012) as required under section 1886(j)(3)(C) of the Social Security Act (the Act). Section 1886(j)(5) of the Act requires the Secretary to publish in the Federal Register on or before the August 1 that precedes the start of each FY the classification and weighting factors for the IRF prospective payment system (PPS) case-mix groups and a description of the methodology and data used in computing the prospective payment rates for that fiscal year. We are also consolidating, clarifying, and revising existing policies regarding IRF hospitals and IRF units of hospitals to eliminate unnecessary confusion and enhance consistency. Furthermore, in accordance with the general principles of the President's January 18, 2011 Executive Order entitled ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review,'' we are amending existing regulatory provisions regarding ''new'' facilities and changes in the bed size and square footage of IRFs and inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs) to improve clarity and remove obsolete material.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy
The Secretary of Education (Secretary) amends the regulations implementing section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act (GEPA), which is commonly referred to as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). These amendments are needed to ensure that the U.S. Department of Education (Department or we) continues to implement FERPA in a way that protects the privacy of education records while allowing for the effective use of data. Improved access to data will facilitate States' ability to evaluate education programs, to ensure limited resources are invested effectively, to build upon what works and discard what does not, to increase accountability and transparency, and to contribute to a culture of innovation and continuous improvement in education. The use of data is vital to ensuring the best education for our children. However, the benefits of using student data must always be balanced with the need to protect student privacy. Protecting student privacy helps achieve a number of important goals, including avoiding discrimination, identity theft, as well as other malicious and damaging criminal acts.

This document contains a proposed rule under title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) that, upon adoption, would implement reporting requirements for multiple employer welfare arrangements (MEWAs) and certain other entities that offer or provide health benefits for employees of two or more employers. The proposal amends existing reporting rules to incorporate new provisions enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act) to more clearly address the reporting obligations of MEWAs that are ERISA plans. This regulation is designed to impose the minimal amount of burden on legally compliant MEWAs and entities claiming exception (ECEs) while implementing the Secretary's authority to take enforcement action against fraudulent or abusive MEWAs included in the Affordable Care Act and working to protect health benefits for businesses and their employees. This proposed rule implements the new provisions while preserving the filing structure and provisions of the 2003 regulations which direct plan MEWAs and non-plan MEWAs to report annually and file upon registration or origination. Elsewhere in this edition of the Federal Register, the Employee Benefits Security Administration (EBSA) is publishing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking related to the Secretary's new enforcement authority with respect to MEWAs and Notices of proposed revisions of the Form M-1 and the Form 5500.

Medicaid Program; Disproportionate Share Hospital Payments-Uninsured Definition
This proposed rule addresses the hospital-specific limitation on Medicaid disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments under the Social Security Act. Under this limitation, DSH payments to a hospital cannot exceed the uncompensated costs of furnishing hospital services by the hospital to individuals who are Medicaid-eligible or ``have no health insurance (or other source of third party coverage) for the services furnished during the year.'' This rule would provide that the quoted phrase would refer in context to a lack of coverage on a service-specific basis, so that the calculation of uncompensated care for purposes of the hospital-specific DSH limit would include the cost of each service furnished to an individual who had no health insurance or other source of third party coverage for that service.

National Practitioner Data Bank
This proposed rule revises existing regulations under sections 401-432 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 and section 1921 of the Social Security Act, governing the National Practitioner Data Bank, to incorporate statutory requirements under section 6403 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act), Public Law 111-148. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also is removing Title 45 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 61, which implemented the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act, the statutory authority for this regulatory action, was designed to eliminate duplicative data reporting and access requirements between the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (established under section 1128E of the Social Security Act) and the National Practitioner Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act requires the Secretary to establish a transition period to transfer all data in the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank to the National Practitioner Data Bank, and, once completed, to cease operations of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Information previously collected and disclosed through the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank will then be collected and disclosed through the National Practitioner Data Bank. This regulatory action consolidates the collection and disclosure of information from both data banks into one part of the CFR.

Protective Force Personnel Medical, Physical Readiness, Training, and Access Authorization Standards
The Department of Energy (DOE or Department) proposes to revise the regulation governing the standards for medical, physical performance, training, and access authorizations for protective force (PF) personnel employed by contractors providing security services to the Department. The existing version of this regulation was promulgated in 1993 and substantial portions of the regulation date to the mid- 1980s. Since 1993 DOE policy has placed greater reliance upon technology, vehicular response, and increased firepower and, correspondingly, has reduced its reliance upon the ability of PF personnel to perform the running tasks required in the current regulation. Furthermore, this shift in emphasis has placed a greater premium upon the retention of mature, tactically experienced, and technically sophisticated personnel, particularly since these personnel represent a considerable investment by DOE in security background investigations and training. The proposed revisions bring DOE PF medical and physical readiness requirements in line with these tactical and organizational priorities. The proposed revisions reduce the exposure of the PF population to injuries related to physical readiness testing. They would create a PF readiness classification designed specifically to encourage the retention of experienced personnel. The revisions would further ensure that PF personnel would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis on their ability to perform the essential functions of their positions without posing a direct threat to themselves or site personnel, the facility, or the general public. The proposed revisions would further ensure that reasonable accommodations would be considered before a determination is made that an individual cannot perform the essential functions of a particular position. The proposed rule also would provide for new medical review processes for PF personnel disqualified from medical certification. The proposed rule would ensure that DOE PF medical and physical readiness requirements would be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Amendment Act of 2009 (ADAAA), the Privacy Act and DOE implementing regulations, and changes in DOE policy regarding PF operations made since the publication of the last version of this rule. In addition, the proposed rule would promote operational efficiency through greater emphasis on aligning training with mission-essential tasks and the increased use of simulation technologies. Finally, the proposed revision would update the regulation to reflect organizational changes in the Office of Health, Safety and Security and the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA).

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program-Stage 2
This proposed rule would specify the Stage 2 criteria that eligible professionals (EPs), eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals (CAHs) must meet in order to qualify for Medicare and/or Medicaid electronic health record (EHR) incentive payments. In addition, it would specify payment adjustments under Medicare for covered professional services and hospital services provided by EPs, eligible hospitals, and CAHs failing to demonstrate meaningful use of certified EHR technology and other program participation requirements. This proposed rule would also revise certain Stage 1 criteria, as well as criteria that apply regardless of Stage, as finalized in the final rule titled Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Electronic Health Record Incentive Program published on July 28, 2010 in the Federal Register. The provisions included in the Medicaid section of this proposed rule (which relate to calculations of patient volume and hospital eligibility) would take effect shortly after finalization of this rule, not subject to the proposed 1 year delay for Stage 2 of meaningful use of certified EHR technology. Changes to Stage 1 of meaningful use would take effect for 2013, but most would be optional until 2014.

Health Information Technology: Standards, Implementation Specifications, and Certification Criteria for Electronic Health Record Technology, 2014 Edition; Revisions to the Permanent Certification Program for Health Information Technology

The proposed new and revised certification criteria would establish the technical capabilities and specify the related standards and implementation specifications that Certified Electronic Health Record (EHR) Technology would need to include to, at a minimum, support the achievement of meaningful use by eligible professionals, eligible hospitals, and critical access hospitals under the Medicare and Medicaid EHR Incentive Programs beginning with the EHR reporting periods in fiscal year and calendar year 2014. This notice of proposed rulemaking also proposes revisions to the permanent certification program for health information technology, which includes changing the program's name.

Medicaid Program; Eligiblity Changes Under the Affordable Care Act of 2010
This final rule implements several provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act). The Affordable Care Act expands access to health insurance coverage through improvements to the Medicaid and Children's Health Insurance (CHIP) programs, the establishment of Affordable Insurance Exchanges (``Exchanges''), and the assurance of coordination between Medicaid, CHIP, and Exchanges. This final rule codifies policy and procedural changes to the Medicaid and CHIP programs related to eligibility, enrollment, renewals, public availability of program information and coordination across insurance affordability programs.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Standards Related to Reinsurance, Risk Corridors and Risk Adjustment
This final rule implements standards for States related to reinsurance and risk adjustment, and for health insurance issuers related to reinsurance, risk corridors, and risk adjustment consistent with title I of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. These programs will mitigate the impact of potential adverse selection and stabilize premiums in the individual and small group markets as insurance reforms and the Affordable Insurance Exchanges (``Exchanges'') are implemented, starting in 2014. The transitional State-based reinsurance program serves to reduce uncertainty by sharing risk in the individual market through making payments for high claims costs for enrollees. The temporary Federally administered risk corridors program serves to protect against uncertainty in rate setting by qualified health plans sharing risk in losses and gains with the Federal government. The permanent State-based risk adjustment program provides payments to health insurance issuers that disproportionately attract high-risk populations (such as individuals with chronic conditions).

Administrative Simplification: Adoption of a Standard for a Unique Health Plan Identifier; Addition to the National Provider Identifier Requirements; and a Change to the Compliance Date for ICD-10-CM and ICD-10-PCS Medical Data Code Sets
This proposed rule would implement section 1104 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (hereinafter referred to as the Affordable Care Act) by establishing new requirements for administrative transactions that would improve the utility of the existing Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) transactions and reduce administrative burden and costs. It proposes the adoption of the standard for a national unique health plan identifier (HPID) and requirements or provisions for the implementation of the HPID. This rule also proposes the adoption of a data element that will serve as an other entity identifier (OEID), an identifier for entities that are not health plans, health care providers, or ``individuals,'' that need to be identified in standard transactions. This proposed rule would also specify the circumstances under which an organization covered health care provider must require certain noncovered individual health care providers who are prescribers to obtain and disclose an NPI. Finally, this rule proposes to change the compliance date for the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) for diagnosis coding, including the Official ICD-10-CM Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, and the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Procedure Coding System (ICD-10-PCS) for inpatient hospital procedure coding, including the Official ICD-10-PCS Guidelines for Coding and Reporting, from October 1, 2013 to October 1, 2014.

National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners
FMCSA establishes a National Registry of Certified Medical Examiners (National Registry) with requirements that all medical examiners who conduct physical examinations for interstate commercial motor vehicle (CMV) drivers meet the following criteria: Complete certain training concerning FMCSA's physical qualification standards, pass a test to verify an understanding of those standards, and maintain and demonstrate competence through periodic training and testing. Following establishment of the National Registry and a transition period, FMCSA will require that motor carriers and drivers use only those medical examiners on the Agency's National Registry and will only accept as valid medical examiner's certificates issued by medical examiners listed on the National Registry. FMCSA is developing the National Registry program to improve highway safety and driver health by requiring that medical examiners be trained and certified so they can determine effectively whether a CMV driver's medical fitness for duty meets FMCSA's standards.

Nationwide Health Information Network: Conditions for Trusted Exchange
The nationwide health information network is defined as the set of standards, services, and policies that enable secure health information exchange over the Internet. Enacted in February 2009, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act requires the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to establish a governance mechanism for the nationwide health information network (section 3001(c)(8) of the Public Health Service Act (PHSA)). This request for information (RFI) is being issued to request public comment on draft proposals the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) is considering in anticipation of developing a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) to establish such a governance mechanism. This RFI seeks broad input on a range of topics, including: The creation of a voluntary program under which entities that facilitate electronic health information exchange could be validated with respect to their conformance to certain ONC-established ``conditions for trusted exchange (CTEs);'' the scope and requirements included in the initial CTEs; the processes that could be used to revise, adopt new, and retire CTEs, including but not limited to the standards development and adoption process provided in section 3004 and other relevant sections of the PHSA; and a process to classify the readiness for nationwide adoption and use of technical standards and implementation specifications to support interoperability related CTEs.

Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991
In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (``FCC'' or ``Commission'') revises its rules to: require prior express written consent for all autodialed or prerecorded telemarketing calls to wireless numbers and for prerecorded calls to residential lines and, accordingly, eliminate the established business relationship exemption for such calls to residential lines while maintaining flexibility in the form of consent needed for purely informational calls; require all prerecorded telemarketing calls to allow consumers to opt out of future prerecorded telemarketing calls using an interactive, automated opt-out mechanism; and limit permissible abandoned calls on a per-calling campaign basis, in order to discourage intrusive calling campaigns. The Commision also exempts from its telemarketing requirements prerecorded calls to residential lines made by health care-related entities governed by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. Taken together, today's actions offer consumers greater protection from intrusive telemarketing calls and protect consumers from unwanted autodialed or prerecorded telemarketing calls to wireless numbers and from unwanted prerecorded telemarketing calls to residential lines, also known as ``telemarketing robocalls,'' and maximize consistency with the analogous Telemarketing Sales Rule (``TSR'') of the Federal Trade Commission (``FTC''), as contemplated by the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act (``DNCIA'') in a way that reduces industry confusion about telemarketers' obligations and does not increase compliance burdens for most telemarketers.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Fiscal Year 2013 Rates; Hospitals' Resident Caps for Graduate Medical Education Payment Purposes; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers and for Ambulatory Surgical Centers
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of the changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act) and other legislation. These changes will be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012, unless otherwise specified in this final rule. We also are updating the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits will be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2012. We are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes made by the Affordable Care Act. Generally, these changes will be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2012, unless otherwise specified in this final rule. In addition, we are implementing changes relating to determining a hospital's full-time equivalent (FTE) resident cap for the purpose of graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are establishing new requirements or revised requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS- exempt cancer hospitals, LTCHs, and inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs)) that are participating in Medicare. We also are establishing new administrative, data completeness, and extraordinary circumstance waivers or extension requests requirements, as well as a reconsideration process, for quality reporting by ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs) that are participating in Medicare. We are establishing requirements for the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program.

Possession, Use, and Transfer of Select Agents and Toxins; Biennial Review
In accordance with the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) located within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has reviewed the list of biological agents and toxins that have the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety and is republishing that list. As a result of our review, we have added Chapare virus, Lujo virus, and SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to the list of HHS select agents and toxins. We have also removed from the list of HHS and overlap select agents and toxins, or excluded from compliance with part 73, the agents and toxins described in the Executive Summary. Further, in accordance with Executive Order 13546, ``Optimizing the Security of Biological Select Agents and Toxins in the United States,'' HHS/CDC has designated those select agents and toxins that present the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with the most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure; or public confidence as ``Tier 1'' agents; established new security requirements for entities possessing Tier 1 agents, including the requirement to conduct pre- access assessments and on-going monitoring of personnel with access to Tier 1 agents and toxins; and made revisions to the regulations to clarify regulatory language concerning security, training, biosafety, and incident response. In a companion document published in this issue of the Federal Register, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has made parallel regulatory changes.

Specifically, these proposed regulations would increase the maximum permissible reward under a health-contingent wellness program offered in connection with a group health plan (and any related health insurance coverage) from 20 percent to 30 percent of the cost of coverage. The proposed regulations would further increase the maximum permissible reward to 50 percent for wellness programs designed to prevent or reduce tobacco use. These regulations also include other proposed clarifications regarding the reasonable design of health-contingent wellness programs and the reasonable alternatives they must offer in order to avoid prohibited discrimination.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; HHS Notice of Benefit and Payment Parameters for 2014
This proposed rule provides further detail and parameters related to: the risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridors programs; cost-sharing reductions; user fees for a Federally- facilitated Exchange; advance payments of the premium tax credit; a Federally-facilitated Small Business Health Option Program; and the medical loss ratio program. The cost-sharing reductions and advanced payments of the premium tax credit, combined with new insurance market reforms, will significantly increase the number of individuals with health insurance coverage, particularly in the individual market. The premium stabilization programs--risk adjustment, reinsurance, and risk corridors--will protect against adverse selection in the newly enrolled population. These programs, in combination with the medical loss ratio program and market reforms extending guaranteed availability (also known as guaranteed issue) protections and prohibiting the use of factors such as health status, medical history, gender, and industry of employment to set premium rates, will help to ensure that every American has access to high-quality, affordable health insurance.

These final rules amend the existing Form M-1 reporting rules by incorporating new provisions enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ``Affordable Care Act''). They also amend existing Form 5500 annual reporting rules for ERISA-covered plans subject to Form M-1 reporting rules. Elsewhere in this edition of the Federal Register, the Employee Benefits Security Administration is publishing final rules related to the Secretary of Labor's new enforcement authority with respect to MEWAs, a notice adopting final revisions to the Form 5500 Annual Return/Report and its instructions to add new Form M-1 compliance questions, as well as an additional notice announcing the finalized revisions to the Form M-1 and its instructions.

Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; Establishment of the Multi-State Plan Program for the Affordable Insurance Exchanges
The U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) is issuing a final regulation establishing the Multi-State Plan Program (MSPP) pursuant to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, referred to collectively as the Affordable Care Act. Through contracts with OPM, health insurance issuers will offer at least two multi-State plans (MSPs) on each of the Affordable Insurance Exchanges (Exchanges). One of the issuers must be non-profit. Under the law, an MSPP issuer may phase in the States in which it offers coverage over 4 years, but it must offer MSPs on Exchanges in all States and the District of Columbia by the fourth year in which the MSPP issuer participates in the MSPP. This rule aims to balance adhering to the statutory goals of MSPP while aligning its standards to those applying to qualified health plans to promote a level playing field across health plans.

Ninety-Day Waiting Period Limitation and Technical Amendments to Certain Health Coverage Requirements Under the Affordable Care Act
These proposed rules implement the 90-day waiting period limitation under section 2708 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. They also propose amendments to regulations to conform to Affordable Care Act provisions already in effect as well as those that will become effective beginning 2014. The proposed conforming amendments make changes to existing requirements such as preexisting condition limitations and other portability provisions added by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and implementing regulations because they have become moot or need amendment due to new market reform protections under the Affordable Care Act.

National Practitioner Data Bank
This final rule revises existing regulations under sections 401-432 of the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986 and section 1921 of the Social Security Act, governing the National Practitioner Data Bank, to incorporate statutory requirements under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Affordable Care Act). The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) also is removing regulations which implemented the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Section 6403 of the Affordable Care Act, the statutory authority for this regulatory action, was designed to eliminate duplicative data reporting and access requirements between the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank (HIPDB) (established under section 1128E of the Social Security Act) and the National Practitioner Data Bank (NPDB). It requires the Secretary to establish a transition period to transfer all data in the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank to the National Practitioner Data Bank, and, once completed, to cease operations of the Healthcare Integrity and Protection Data Bank. Information previously collected and disclosed to eligible parties through the HIPDB will then be collected and disclosed to eligible parties through the NPDB. This regulatory action consolidates the collection and disclosure of information from both data banks into one part of the CFR.

This rule implements policy, assigns responsibilities, and provides guidance and procedures for the SAPR Program; establishes the processes and procedures for the Sexual Assault Forensic Examination (SAFE) Kit; establishes the multidisciplinary Case Management Group (CMG) and provides guidance on how to handle sexual assault; establishes SAPR minimum program standards, SAPR training requirements, and SAPR requirements for the DoD Annual Report on Sexual Assault in the Military. The Department of Defense Sexual Assault Prevention and Response (SAPR) program continues to evolve, and the Department is committed to incorporating best practices and Congressional requirements to ensure that sexual assault victims receive the services they need. As part of this commitment and in addition to the Interim Final Rule, the Department is exploring the feasibility and advisability of extending the Restricted Reporting option to DoD civilians and contractors serving overseas.

HIPAA Privacy Rule and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)
On January 16, 2013, President Barack Obama announced a series of Executive Actions to reduce gun violence in the United States, including efforts to improve the Federal government's background check system for the sale or transfer of firearms by licensed dealers, called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). Among those persons disqualified from possessing or receiving firearms under Federal law are individuals who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution; found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity; or otherwise have been determined, through a formal adjudication process, to have a severe mental condition that results in the individuals presenting a danger to themselves or others or being incapable of managing their own affairs (referred to below as the ``mental health prohibitor''). Concerns have been raised that, in certain states, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule may be a barrier to States' reporting the identities of individuals subject to the mental health prohibitor to the NICS. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or ``the Department''), which administers the HIPAA regulations, is issuing this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) to solicit public comments on such barriers to reporting and ways in which these barriers can be addressed. In particular, we are considering creating an express permission in the HIPAA rules for reporting the relevant information to the NICS by those HIPAA covered entities responsible for involuntary commitments or the formal adjudications that would subject individuals to the mental health prohibitor, or that are otherwise designated by the States to report to the NICS. In addition, we are soliciting comments on the best methods to disseminate information on relevant HIPAA policies to State level entities that originate or maintain information that may be reported to NICS. Finally, we are soliciting public input on whether there are ways to mitigate any unintended adverse consequences for individuals seeking needed mental health services that may be caused by creating express regulatory permission to report relevant information to NICS. The Department will use the information it receives to determine how best to address these issues.

Medicare Program; Requirements for the Medicare Incentive Reward Program and Provider Enrollment
This proposed rule would revise the Incentive Reward Program provisions in Sec. 420.405 and certain provider enrollment requirements in part 424, subpart P. The most significant of these revisions include: changing the Incentive Reward Program potential reward amount for information on individuals and entities who are or have engaged in acts or omissions which resulted in the imposition of a sanction from 10 percent of the overpayments recovered in the case or $1,000, whichever is less, to 15 percent of the final amount collected applied to the first $66,000,000 for the sanctionable conduct; expanding the instances in which a felony conviction can serve as a basis for denial or revocation of a provider or supplier's enrollment; if certain criteria are met, enabling us to deny enrollment if the enrolling provider, supplier, or owner thereof had an ownership relationship with a previously enrolled provider or supplier that had a Medicare debt; enabling us to revoke Medicare billing privileges if we determine that the provider or supplier has a pattern or practice of submitting claims for services that fail to meet Medicare requirements; and limiting the ability of ambulance suppliers to ``backbill'' for services performed prior to enrollment. We believe this proposed rule would--increase the incentive for individuals to report information on individuals and entities that have or are engaged in sanctionable conduct; improve our ability to detect new fraud schemes; and help us ensure that fraudulent entities and individuals do not enroll in or maintain their enrollment in the Medicare program.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Proposed Fiscal Year 2014 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Hospital Conditions of Participation
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of the proposed changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act) and other legislation. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule. We also are proposing to update the rate-of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2013. We are proposing to update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implement certain statutory changes made by the Affordable Care Act. Generally, these proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2013, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule. In addition, we are proposing a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are proposing to establish new requirements or revised requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, LTCHs, and inpatient psychiatric facilities (IPFs)) that are participating in Medicare. We are proposing to update policies relating to the Hospital Value- Based Purchasing (VBP) Program and the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program. In addition, we are proposing to revise the conditions of participation (CoPs) for hospitals relating to the administration of vaccines by nursing staff as well as the CoPs for critical access hospitals relating to the provision of acute care inpatient services.

State Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program
The Administration on Aging (AoA) of the Administration for Community Living (ACL) within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, with request for comments, to implement provisions of the Older Americans Act, the State Long-Term Care Ombudsman program. This proposed rule replaces AoA's 1994 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Since 1992, the functions of this program have been delineated in the Older Americans Act; however, regulations have not been promulgated for any Title VII program. In the absence of regulatory guidance, there has been significant variation in the interpretation and implementation of these provisions among States. Recent inquiries from States and an AoA compliance review in one State have highlighted the difficulty of determining State compliance in carrying out the Long-Term Care Ombudsman program functions. This rulemaking provides the first regulatory guidance for States' Long-Term Care Ombudsman programs to provide clarity about implementation. HHS estimates that a number of states may need to update their statutes, regulations, policies and/or practices in order to operate the program consistent with federal law and this proposed regulation. The effective date of the rule is anticipated to be one year after publication of any final rule to allow States appropriate time for such changes, if needed. AoA anticipates little or no financial impact on the providers of long-term care ombudsman services, the consumers served by the program, or long-term care providers through implementation of the proposed rules. AoA believes that consumers (particularly residents of long-term care facilities) and long-term care providers will benefit from the implementation of these proposed rules. Consumers and other complainants across the country will receive services from the Long- Term Care Ombudsman program with less variation in the quality, efficiency, and consistency of service delivery. Long-term care ombudsmen and States will also benefit from the implementation of these proposed rules in the establishment and operation of the Long-Term Care Ombudsman program at the State and local levels. For years, States and long-term care ombudsmen at every level have reported to AoA that they have found some provisions of the Act confusing to implement. The proposed rule seeks to provide the clarity that program stakeholders have requested.

Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act
This document contains final regulations regarding coverage of certain preventive services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2713 of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services by non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. Among these services are women's preventive health services, as specified in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). As authorized by the current regulations, and consistent with the HRSA guidelines, group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) are exempt from the otherwise applicable requirement to cover certain contraceptive services. These final regulations simplify and clarify the religious employer exemption. These final regulations also establish accommodations with respect to the contraceptive coverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans), as well as student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education. These regulations also finalize related amendments to regulations concerning Affordable Insurance Exchanges.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Home Health Prospective Payment System Rate Update for CY 2014, Home Health Quality Reporting Requirements, and Cost Allocation of Home Health Survey Expenses
This proposed rule would update the Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS) rates, including the national, standardized 60- day episode payment rates, the national per-visit rates, the low- utilization payment adjustment (LUPA) add-on, the nonroutine medical supplies (NRS) conversion factor, and outlier payments under the Medicare prospective payment system for home health agencies (HHAs), effective January 1, 2014. As required by the Affordable Care Act, this rule also proposes rebasing adjustments, with a 4-year phase-in, to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rates; the national per- visit rates; and the NRS conversion factor. Finally, the proposed rule would also establish home health quality reporting requirements for CY 2014 payment and subsequent years and would clarify that a state Medicaid program must provide that, in certifying home health agencies, the state's designated survey agency must carry out certain other responsibilities that already apply to surveys of nursing facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF-IID), including sharing in the cost of HHA surveys. For that portion of costs attributable to Medicare and Medicaid, we would assign 50 percent to Medicare and 50 percent to Medicaid, the standard method that CMS and states use in the allocation of expenses related to surveys of SNF/NF nursing homes.

This final rule implements provisions of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively referred to as the Affordable Care Act). Specifically, this final rule outlines Exchange standards with respect to eligibility appeals, agents and brokers, privacy and security, issuer direct enrollment, and the handling of consumer cases. It also sets forth standards with respect to a State's operation of the Exchange and Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP). It generally is finalizing previously proposed policies without change.

Medical, Physical Readiness, Training, and Access Authorization Standards for Protective Force Personnel
The Department of Energy (DOE or Department) is amending its regulations governing the standards for medical, physical performance, training, and access authorizations for protective force (PF) personnel employed by contractors providing security services to the Department. Since the publication of the existing regulations in 1984, and particularly since 9/11, the DOE has totally transformed its approach to dealing with a much-evolved terrorist threat. This transformation has been informed by repeated analysis and testing since 9/11. The primary changes are: a move to more sophisticated weapons and detection and targeting systems, an increased reliance on hardened positions and armored response vehicles, and increased use of barriers to channel adversaries. The result is a defensive strategy designed to take full advantage of the fact that the terrorist must fight through the protective force to reach our SNM and other targets. This contrasts directly with the posture in the 1980s and 1990s. Today we expect the terrorist to fight his way through a pre-positioned, layered defense, which places a premium on operating sophisticated weapons and detection and tracking systems. The proposed revisions bring DOE protective force firearms qualification, training, medical and physical readiness requirements in line with these tactical and organizational priorities of 2013. It removes barriers to maintaining the desired experience levels of our protective forces while maintaining established qualification standards. The revised regulations: emphasize firearms training and proficiency testing that reflect current military practice and simulations technology, maximizing training time and decreasing cost; implements the Mission Essential Task List (METL) training framework adapted from the military, which allows for more effective use of training resources by aligning them with validated mission performance priorities, eliminate medical disqualifications for conditions which have become completely treatable since the 1980s, refines a physical readiness testing regimen that currently diverts time and training emphasis from tasks more directly supportive of mission success; and above all, encourage protective force personnel to stay sharp and mission-focused. Furthermore, this shift in emphasis has placed a greater premium upon the retention of mature, tactically experienced, and technically sophisticated personnel, particularly since these personnel represent a considerable investment by DOE in security background investigations and training. The revisions bring DOE PF medical and physical readiness requirements in line with these tactical and organizational priorities. The revisions reduce the exposure of the PF population to injuries related to physical readiness testing. The revisions further ensure that PF personnel are evaluated on a case-by- case basis on their ability to perform the essential functions of their positions without posing a direct threat to themselves or site personnel, the facility, or the general public. The revisions further ensure that reasonable accommodations are considered before a determination is made that an individual cannot perform the essential functions of a particular position. The rule also provides for new medical review processes for PF personnel disqualified from medical certification. The rule ensures that DOE PF medical and physical readiness requirements are compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended by the Americans with Disabilities Act Amendments Act of 2009 (ADAAA), the Privacy Act and DOE implementing regulations, and changes in DOE policy regarding PF operations made since the publication of the last version of this rule. Finally, the revision updates the regulation to reflect organizational changes in the Office of Health, Safety and Security and the creation of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) as a semi- autonomous agency within the Department of Energy.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Home Health Prospective Payment System Rate Update for CY 2014, Home Health Quality Reporting Requirements, and Cost Allocation of Home Health Survey Expenses
This final rule will update the Home Health Prospective Payment System (HH PPS) rates, including the national, standardized 60- day episode payment rates, the national per-visit rates, the low- utilization payment adjustment (LUPA) add-on, and the non-routine medical supply (NRS) conversion factor under the Medicare prospective payment system for home health agencies (HHAs), effective January 1, 2014. As required by the Affordable Care Act, this rule establishes rebasing adjustments, with a 4-year phase-in, to the national, standardized 60-day episode payment rates; the national per-visit rates; and the NRS conversion factor. In addition, this final rule will remove 170 diagnosis codes from assignment to diagnosis groups within the HH PPS Grouper, effective January 1, 2014. Finally, this rule will establish home health quality reporting requirements for CY 2014 payment and subsequent years and will clarify that a state Medicaid program must provide that, in certifying HHAs, the state's designated survey agency carry out certain other responsibilities that already apply to surveys of nursing facilities and Intermediate Care Facilities for Individuals with Intellectual Disabilities (ICF-IID), including sharing in the cost of HHA surveys. For that portion of costs attributable to Medicare and Medicaid, we will assign 50 percent to Medicare and 50 percent to Medicaid, the standard method that CMS and states use in the allocation of expenses related to surveys of nursing homes.

Medicare and Medicaid Programs; Emergency Preparedness Requirements for Medicare and Medicaid Participating Providers and Suppliers
This proposed rule would establish national emergency preparedness requirements for Medicare- and Medicaid-participating providers and suppliers to ensure that they adequately plan for both natural and man-made disasters, and coordinate with federal, state, tribal, regional, and local emergency preparedness systems. It would also ensure that these providers and suppliers are adequately prepared to meet the needs of patients, residents, clients, and participants during disasters and emergency situations. We are proposing emergency preparedness requirements that 17 provider and supplier types must meet to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Since existing Medicare and Medicaid requirements vary across the types of providers and suppliers, we are also proposing variations in these requirements. These variations are based on existing statutory and regulatory policies and differing needs of each provider or supplier type and the individuals to whom they provide health care services. Despite these variations, our proposed regulations would provide generally consistent emergency preparedness requirements, enhance patient safety during emergencies for persons served by Medicare- and Medicaid-participating facilities, and establish a more coordinated and defined response to natural and man- made disasters.

Introduction to the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions
The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires that agencies publish semiannual regulatory agendas in the Federal Register describing regulatory actions they are developing that may have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities (5 U.S.C. 602). Executive Order 12866 ``Regulatory Planning and Review,'' signed September 30, 1993 (58 FR 51735), and incorporated in Executive Order 13563, ``Improving Regulation and Regulatory Review'' issued on January 18, 2011 (76 FR 3821) establish guidelines and procedures for agencies' agendas, including specific types of information for each entry. The Unified Agenda of Federal Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions (Unified Agenda) helps agencies fulfill these requirements. All Federal regulatory agencies have chosen to publish their regulatory agendas as part of the Unified Agenda. The complete 2013 Unified Agenda and Regulatory Plan, which contains the regulatory agendas for 60 Federal agencies, is available to the public at http://reginfo.gov. The 2013 Unified Agenda publication appearing in the Federal Register consists of agency regulatory flexibility agendas, in accordance with the publication requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Agency regulatory flexibility agendas contain only those Agenda entries for rules that are likely to have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities and entries that have been selected for periodic review under section 610 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.

Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule and the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS)
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS or ``the Department'') is issuing this notice of proposed rulemaking to modify the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule to expressly permit certain HIPAA covered entities to disclose to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) the identities of individuals who are subject to a Federal ``mental health prohibitor'' that disqualifies them from shipping, transporting, possessing, or receiving a firearm. The NICS is a national system maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to conduct background checks on persons who may be disqualified from receiving firearms based on federally prohibited categories or State law. Among the persons subject to the Federal mental health prohibitor are individuals who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution; found incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity; or otherwise have been determined by a court, board, commission, or other lawful authority to be a danger to themselves or others or to lack the mental capacity to contract or manage their own affairs, as a result of marked subnormal intelligence or mental illness, incompetency, condition, or disease. Under this proposal, only covered entities with lawful authority to make adjudication or commitment decisions that make individuals subject to the Federal mental health prohibitor, or that serve as repositories of information for NICS reporting purposes, would be permitted to disclose the information needed for these purposes. This disclosure would be restricted to limited demographic and certain other information and would not include medical records, or any mental health information beyond the indication that the individual is subject to the Federal mental health prohibitor. HHS notes that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has proposed clarifications to the regulatory definitions relevant to the Federal mental health prohibitor. The DOJ proposal is published elsewhere in this issue of the Federal Register. While commenters should consider this proposed regulation in light of the clarifications proposed in DOJ's proposal, we note that those clarifications would not change how this proposed HIPAA permission would operate.

CLIA Program and HIPAA Privacy Rule; Patients' Access to Test Reports
This final rule amends the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) regulations to specify that, upon the request of a patient (or the patient's personal representative), laboratories subject to CLIA may provide the patient, the patient's personal representative, or a person designated by the patient, as applicable, with copies of completed test reports that, using the laboratory's authentication process, can be identified as belonging to that patient. Subject to conforming amendments, the final rule retains the existing provisions that require release of test reports only to authorized persons and, if applicable, to the persons responsible for using the test reports and to the laboratory that initially requested the test. In addition, this final rule amends the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) Privacy Rule to provide individuals (or their personal representatives) with the right to access test reports directly from laboratories subject to HIPAA (and to direct that copies of those test reports be transmitted to persons or entities designated by the individual) by removing the exceptions for CLIA-certified laboratories and CLIA-exempt laboratories from the provision that provides individuals with the right of access to their protected health information. These changes to the CLIA regulations and the HIPAA Privacy Rule provide individuals with a greater ability to access their health information, empowering them to take a more active role in managing their health and health care.

Ninety-Day Waiting Period Limitation and Technical Amendments to Certain Health Coverage Requirements Under the Affordable Care Act
These final regulations implement the 90-day waiting period limitation under section 2708 of the Public Health Service Act, as added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. These regulations also finalize amendments to existing regulations to conform to Affordable Care Act provisions. Specifically, these rules amend regulations implementing existing provisions such as some of the portability provisions added by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) because those provisions of the HIPAA regulations have become superseded or require amendment as a result of the market reform protections added by the Affordable Care Act.

Specifically, the rule proposes standards related to product discontinuation and renewal, quality reporting, non-discrimination standards, minimum certification standards and responsibilities of qualified health plan (QHP) issuers, the Small Business Health Options Program, and enforcement remedies in Federally-facilitated Exchanges. It also proposes: A modification of HHS's allocation of reinsurance contributions collected if those contributions do not meet our projections; certain changes to the ceiling on allowable administrative expenses in the risk corridors calculation; modifications to the way we calculate certain cost-sharing parameters so that we round those parameters down to the nearest $50 increment; certain approaches we are considering to index the required contribution used to determine eligibility for an exemption from the shared responsibility payment under section 5000A of the Internal Revenue Code; grounds for imposing civil money penalties on persons who provide false or fraudulent information to the Exchange and on persons who improperly use or disclose information; updated standards for the consumer assistance programs; standards related to the opt-out provisions for self-funded, non-Federal governmental plans and the individual market provisions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; standards for recognition of certain types of foreign group health coverage as minimum essential coverage; amendments to Exchange appeals standards and coverage enrollment and termination standards; and time-limited adjustments to the standards relating to the medical loss ratio program.

Lowering Miners' Exposure to Respirable Coal Mine Dust, Including Continuous Personal Dust Monitors
The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) is revising the Agency's existing standards on miners' occupational exposure to respirable coal mine dust in order to: Lower the existing exposure limits; provide for full-shift sampling; redefine the term ``normal production shift''; and add reexamination and decertification requirements for persons certified to sample for dust, and maintain and calibrate sampling devices. In addition, the rule provides for single shift compliance sampling by MSHA inspectors, establishes sampling requirements for mine operators' use of the Continuous Personal Dust Monitor (CPDM), requires operator corrective action on a single, full- shift operator sample, changes the averaging method to determine compliance on operator samples, and expands requirements for medical surveillance of coal miners. Chronic exposure to respirable coal mine dust causes lung diseases that can lead to permanent disability and death. The final rule will greatly improve health protections for coal miners by reducing their occupational exposure to respirable coal mine dust and by lowering the risk that they will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity over their working lives.

We are also proposing to collect data on the amount and mode (that is, Individual, Group, and Co-Treatment) of therapy provided in the IRF setting according to therapy discipline, revise the list of impairment group codes that presumptively meet the ``60 percent rule'' compliance criteria, provide for a new item on the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility-Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF-PAI) form to indicate whether the prior treatment and severity requirements have been met for arthritis cases to presumptively meet the ``60 percent rule'' compliance criteria, and revise and update quality measures and reporting requirements under the IRF quality reporting program (QRP). In this proposed rule, we also address the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), for the IRF prospective payment system (PPS), effective when ICD-10-CM becomes the required medical data code set for use on Medicare claims and IRF-PAI submissions.

This proposed rule would update the hospice payment rates and the wage index for fiscal year (FY) 2015 and continue the phase out of the wage index budget neutrality adjustment factor (BNAF). This rule provides an update on hospice payment reform analyses and solicits comments on ``terminal illness'' and ``related conditions'' definitions, and on a process and appeals for Part D payment for drugs, while beneficiaries are under a hospice election. Also, this rule proposes timeframes for filing the notice of election and the notice of termination/revocation; adding the attending physician to the hospice election form; a requirement that hospices complete their hospice inpatient and aggregate cap determinations within 5 months after the cap year ends, and remit any overpayments; and updates for the hospice quality reporting program. In addition, this rule would provide guidance on determining hospice eligibility, information on the delay in the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), and would further clarify how hospices are to report diagnoses on hospice claims. Finally, the rule proposes to make a technical regulatory text change.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Proposed Fiscal Year 2015 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Reasonable Compensation Equivalents for Physician Services in Excluded Teaching Hospitals; Provider Administrative Appeals and Judicial Review; Enforcement Provisions for Organ Transplant Centers; and Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program
We are proposing to revise the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of the proposed changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act), the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and other legislation. These proposed changes would be applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, unless otherwise specified in this proposed rule. We also are proposing to update the rate-of- increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The proposed updated rate-of-increase limits would be effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. We also are proposing to update the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and to implement certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition we are proposing to revise the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and to retire the ``5 percent'' payment adjustment for co-located LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act will apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond. However, in light of the degree of forthcoming change, we discuss changes infra and request public feedback to inform our proposals for FY 2016 in this proposed rule as well. In addition, we are proposing to make a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are proposing to establish new requirements or revise requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS-exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs) that are participating in Medicare. We are proposing to update policies relating to the Hospital Value- Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. In addition, we are proposing changes to the regulations governing provider administrative appeals and judicial review relating to appropriate claims in provider cost reports; updates to the reasonable compensation equivalent (RCE) limits for services furnished by physicians to teaching hospitals excluded from the IPPS; regulatory revisions to broaden the specified uses of risk adjustment data and to specify the conditions for release of risk adjustment data to entities outside of CMS; and changes to the enforcement procedures for organ transplant centers. We are proposing to align the reporting and submission timelines for clinical quality measures for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) with the reporting and submission timelines for the Hospital IQR Program. In addition, we provide guidance and clarification of certain policies for eligible hospitals and CAHs such as our policy for reporting zero denominators on clinical quality measures and our policy for case threshold exemptions.

This proposed rule would revise the Medicare hospital outpatient prospective payment system (OPPS) and the Medicare ambulatory surgical center (ASC) payment system for CY 2015 to implement applicable statutory requirements and changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems.

Medicare Program; Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility Prospective Payment System for Federal Fiscal Year 2015

This final rule finalizes a policy to collect data on the amount and mode (that is, Individual, Concurrent, Group, and Co-Treatment) of therapy provided in the IRF setting according to therapy discipline, revises the list of diagnosis and impairment group codes that presumptively meet the ``60 percent rule'' compliance criteria, provides a way for IRFs to indicate on the Inpatient Rehabilitation Facility-Patient Assessment Instrument (IRF- PAI) form whether the prior treatment and severity requirements have been met for arthritis cases to presumptively meet the ``60 percent rule'' compliance criteria, and revises and updates quality measures and reporting requirements under the IRF quality reporting program (QRP). This rule also delays the effective date for the revisions to the list of diagnosis codes that are used to determine presumptive compliance under the ``60 percent rule'' that were finalized in FY 2014 IRF PPS final rule and adopts the revisions to the list of diagnosis codes that are used to determine presumptive compliance under the ``60 percent rule'' that are finalized in this rule. This final rule also addresses the implementation of the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), for the IRF prospective payment system (PPS), which will be effective when ICD-10- CM becomes the required medical data code set for use on Medicare claims and IRF-PAI submissions.

Medicare Program; Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment Systems for Acute Care Hospitals and the Long-Term Care Hospital Prospective Payment System and Fiscal Year 2015 Rates; Quality Reporting Requirements for Specific Providers; Reasonable Compensation Equivalents for Physician Services in Excluded Hospitals and Certain Teaching Hospitals; Provider Administrative Appeals and Judicial Review; Enforcement Provisions for Organ Transplant Centers; and Electronic Health Record (EHR) Incentive Program
We are revising the Medicare hospital inpatient prospective payment systems (IPPS) for operating and capital-related costs of acute care hospitals to implement changes arising from our continuing experience with these systems. Some of these changes implement certain statutory provisions contained in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively known as the Affordable Care Act), the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, and other legislation. These changes are applicable to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, unless otherwise specified in this final rule. We also are updating the rate- of-increase limits for certain hospitals excluded from the IPPS that are paid on a reasonable cost basis subject to these limits. The updated rate-of-increase limits are effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 2014. We also are updating the payment policies and the annual payment rates for the Medicare prospective payment system (PPS) for inpatient hospital services provided by long-term care hospitals (LTCHs) and implementing certain statutory changes to the LTCH PPS under the Affordable Care Act and the Pathway for Sustainable Growth Rate (SGR) Reform Act of 2013 and the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. In addition, we discuss our proposals on the interruption of stay policy for LTCHs and on retiring the ``5 percent'' payment adjustment for co-located LTCHs. While many of the statutory mandates of the Pathway for SGR Reform Act apply to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2014, others will not begin to apply until 2016 and beyond. In addition, we are making a number of changes relating to direct graduate medical education (GME) and indirect medical education (IME) payments. We are establishing new requirements or revising requirements for quality reporting by specific providers (acute care hospitals, PPS- exempt cancer hospitals, and LTCHs) that are participating in Medicare. We are updating policies relating to the Hospital Value-Based Purchasing (VBP) Program, the Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program, and the Hospital-Acquired Condition (HAC) Reduction Program. In addition, we are making technical corrections to the regulations governing provider administrative appeals and judicial review; updating the reasonable compensation equivalent (RCE) limits, and revising the methodology for determining such limits, for services furnished by physicians to certain teaching hospitals and hospitals excluded from the IPPS; making regulatory revisions to broaden the specified uses of Medicare Advantage (MA) risk adjustment data and to specify the conditions for release of such risk adjustment data to entities outside of CMS; and making changes to the enforcement procedures for organ transplant centers. We are aligning the reporting and submission timelines for clinical quality measures for the Medicare EHR Incentive Program for eligible hospitals and critical access hospitals (CAHs) with the reporting and submission timelines for the Hospital IQR Program. In addition, we provide guidance and clarification of certain policies for eligible hospitals and CAHs such as our policy for reporting zero denominators on clinical quality measures and our policy for case threshold exemptions. In this document, we are finalizing two interim final rules with comment period relating to criteria for disproportionate share hospital uncompensated care payments and extensions of temporary changes to the payment adjustment for low-volume hospitals and of the Medicare- Dependent, Small Rural Hospital (MDH) Program.

Coverage of Certain Preventive Services Under the Affordable Care Act
This document proposes a change to the definition of an eligible organization that can avail itself of an accommodation with respect to coverage of certain preventive services under section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act (PHS Act), added by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended, and incorporated into the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. Section 2713 of the PHS Act requires coverage without cost sharing of certain preventive health services by non-grandfathered group health plans and health insurance coverage. Among these services are women's preventive health services, as specified in guidelines supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). As authorized by the current regulations, and consistent with the HRSA Guidelines, group health plans established or maintained by certain religious employers (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans) are exempt from the otherwise applicable requirement to cover certain contraceptive services. Additionally, under current regulations, accommodations are available with respect to the contraceptive coverage requirement for group health plans established or maintained by eligible organizations (and group health insurance coverage provided in connection with such plans), and student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education, that effectively exempt them from this requirement. The regulations establish a mechanism for separately furnishing payments for contraceptive services on behalf of participants and beneficiaries of the group health plans of eligible organizations that avail themselves of an accommodation, and enrollees and dependents of student health insurance coverage arranged by eligible organizations that are institutions of higher education that avail themselves of an accommodation. These rules propose and seek comments on potential changes to the definition of ``eligible organization'' in the Departments' regulations in light of the Supreme Court's decision in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014), to ensure that participants and beneficiaries in group health plans (and enrollees and dependents in student health insurance coverage arranged by institutions of higher education) obtain, without additional cost, coverage of the full range of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved contraceptive services, as prescribed by a health care provider, while respecting certain closely held for-profit entities' religion-based objections to contraceptive coverage. These proposed rules also seek comments on any additional steps the government should take to help ensure coverage of the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives, as prescribed by a health care provider, without cost sharing, for participants and beneficiaries in group health plans of such entities (and enrollees and dependents in student health insurance coverage arranged by such entities that are institutions of higher education).
