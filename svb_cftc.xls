Regulation of Off-Exchange Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions and Intermediaries
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing to adopt a comprehensive regulatory scheme (``Proposal'') to implement the CFTC Reauthorization Act of 2008 (``CRA'') \1\ with respect to off-exchange transactions in foreign currency with members of the retail public (i.e., ``retail forex transactions''). The Commodity Exchange Act, as amended by the CRA, generally provides that the Commission's jurisdiction extends to contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery (or an option on such a contract) or an option (other than an option executed or traded on a national securities exchange), and to certain leveraged or margined contracts in foreign currency that are offered to or entered into with retail customers. The Commission is proposing a scheme that would put in place requirements for, among other things, registration, disclosure, recordkeeping, financial reporting, minimum capital, and other operational standards, based on both the CFTC's existing regulations for commodity interest transactions and commodity interest intermediaries, as well as rules of the National Futures Association (``NFA'') that are already existing with respect to retail forex transactions offered by NFA's members. Additionally, the Proposal would amend existing regulations as needed to clarify their application to, and inclusion in, the new regulatory scheme for retail forex. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Federal Speculative Position Limits for Referenced Energy Contracts and Associated Regulations
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or ``Commission'') is proposing to implement speculative position limits for futures and option contracts in certain energy commodities. The Commodity Exchange Act of 1936 (``CEA'' or ``Act'') gives the Commission the authority to establish limits on positions to diminish, eliminate or prevent excessive speculation causing sudden or unreasonable fluctuations in the price of a commodity, or unwarranted changes in the price of a commodity. In addition to identifying the affected energy contracts and the position limits that would apply to them, the notice of proposed rulemaking includes provisions relating to exemptions from the position limits for bona fide hedging transactions and for certain swap dealer risk management transactions. The notice of proposed rulemaking also sets out an application process that would apply to swap dealers seeking a risk management exemption from the position limits, as well as related definitions and reporting requirements. In addition, the notice of proposed rulemaking includes provisions regarding the aggregation of positions under common ownership for the purpose of applying the limits.

Delegations of Authority To Disclose Confidential Information

The Commission's proposal would also clarify that confidential information provided by the Commission to registered entities may only be used for market surveillance, audit, investigative or rule enforcement purposes and would remove the requirement that disclosures of confidential information to foreign government agencies and foreign futures authorities require the concurrence of the Commission's Division of Enforcement. Finally, the proposal would make certain other technical and conforming amendments to the Commission's rules.

Co-Location/Proximity Hosting Services

The Proposal also addresses fees for these services and would require that fees be equitable, uniform, and non-discriminatory, while taking into account the different level of services that may be required by various market participants and requires DCMs, DTEFs, and ECMs with SPDCs, that offer co-location and/ or proximity hosting services, to disclose publicly, via their Web sites, the longest, shortest, and average latencies for each connectivity option. Finally, the Proposal would require DCMs, DTEFs, and ECMs with SPDCs, that approve third-parties to provide co-location and/or proximity hosting services to ensure they have sufficient agreements in place to obtain all information necessary from those third-parties to carry out their self-regulatory obligations and other obligations under the Commodity Exchange Act (``Act'') and Commission Regulations.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is publishing for comment an interim final rule to implement new statutory provisions introduced by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). Section 729 of the Dodd-Frank Act requires the CFTC to adopt, within 90 days of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, an interim final rule for the reporting of swap transactions entered into before July 21, 2010 whose terms had not expired as of that date (``pre-enactment unexpired swaps''). Pursuant to this mandate, the CFTC is today adopting an interim final rule requiring specified counterparties to pre-enactment unexpired swap transactions to report certain information related to such transactions to a registered swap data repository (``SDR'') \1\ or to the Commission by the compliance date to be established in reporting rules required under Section2(h)(5) of the CEA, or within 60 days after an SDR becomes registered under Section 21 of the CEA, whichever occurs first. An interpretive note to the rule advises that counterparties that may be required to report to an SDR or the CFTC will need to preserve information pertaining to the terms of such swaps. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Affiliate Marketing and Disposal of Consumer Information Rules
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing regulations to implement new statutory provisions enacted by Title X of the ``Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act'' (``Dodd-Frank Act''). These proposed regulations apply to futures commission merchants, retail foreign exchange dealers, commodity trading advisors, commodity pool operators, introducing brokers, swap dealers and major swap participants (collectively, ``CFTC registrants''). The Dodd-Frank Act provides the CFTC with authority to implement regulations under sections 624 and 628 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (``FCRA'').

The proposed regulations implementing section 628 of the FCRA require CFTC registrants that possess or maintain consumer report information in connection with their business activities to develop and implement a written program for the proper disposal of such information.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing rules to implement new statutory provisions enacted under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') and amend existing rules affected by the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. These proposed rules apply to designated contract markets (``DCMs''), derivatives clearing organizations (``DCOs''), swap execution facilities (``SEFs'') and swap data repositories (``SDRs''). The proposed rules implement the new statutory framework for certification and approval for new products, new rules and rule amendments submitted to the Commission by registered entities. Furthermore, the proposed rules prohibit event contracts based on certain excluded commodities, establish special procedures for certain rule changes proposed by systemically important derivatives clearing organizations (``SIDCOs''), and provide for the tolling of review periods for certain novel derivative products pending the resolution of jurisdictional determinations.

Position Reports for Physical Commodity Swaps
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing reporting regulations that are reasonably necessary for implementing and enforcing aggregate position limits for certain physical commodity derivatives. As a result of recent legislative reforms, the Commission may adopt regulations establishing aggregate position limits for designated contract market (``DCM'') physical commodity futures contracts and swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts. The Commission currently receives, and uses for market surveillance purposes, including position limit enforcement, data on large positions in all physical commodity futures and option contracts traded on DCMs. However, there is no analogous reporting structure in place for economically equivalent swaps, which until recently were largely unregulated financial contracts. The Commission's proposal would require position reports on economically equivalent swaps from clearing organizations, their members and swap dealers. Notably, the proposed regulations also include a sunset provision. The sunset provision would render the regulations ineffective upon the Commission's issuance of an order finding that operating swap data repositories (``SDRs'') are capable of processing positional data in a manner that would enable the Commission to set and enforce aggregate position limits.

Reporting Certain Post-Enactment Swap Transactions

Section 723 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends Section 2 of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or the ``Act'') by adding new Section 2(h)(5)(B), which directs that rules adopted by the Commission under this section shall provide for the reporting of ``transition'' swaps--that is, swaps entered into on or after the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and prior to the effective date of swap data reporting rules to implement Section 2(h)(5)(B)--to a registered swap data repository (``SDR'') or to the Commission. Each category of data is subject to a reporting timetable specified in Section 2(h)(5). The Commission intends shortly to notice for comment substantive rules implementing the swap data reporting provisions of Section 2(h)(5)(B). In order to ensure the preservation of data pending implementation of such rules, the Commission is today adopting an interim final rule directing specified counterparties to post-enactment, or transition, swap transactions entered into prior to the effective date of the swap data reporting and recordkeeping rules implementing Section 2(h)(5)(B) of the CEA to retain information pertaining to the terms of such swaps.

Order Exempting the Trading and Clearing of Certain Products Related to the CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index and Similar Products
On November 10, 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or the ``Commission'') published for public comment in the Federal Register a proposal to exempt the trading and clearing of certain options (``Options'') on the CBOE Gold ETF Volatility Index (``GVZ Index''), which would be traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange (``CBOE''), a national securities exchange, and cleared through the Options Clearing Corporation (``OCC'') in its capacity as a registered securities clearing agency, from the provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') and the regulations thereunder, to the extent necessary to permit such Options to be so traded and cleared. The Commission also requested comment regarding whether it should provide a categorical exemption that would permit the trading and clearing of options on indexes that measure the volatility of shares of gold exchange-traded funds (``ETFs'') generally, regardless of issuer, including options on any index that measures the magnitude of changes in, and is composed of the price(s) of shares of one or more gold ETFs and the price(s) of any other instrument(s), which other instruments are securities as defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``the '34 Act''). The Commission has determined to issue this Order essentially as proposed. Authority for these exemptions is found in Sec. 4(c) of the CEA.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the ``Commission'') hereby proposes regulations to further implement new statutory provisions enacted by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). Specifically, the Commission proposes certain substantive requirements on the resolution of conflicts of interest, in order to further implement core principles applicable to derivatives clearing organizations (``DCOs''), designated contract markets (``DCMs''), and swap execution facilities (``SEFs''). Such substantive requirements address reporting, transparency in decision-making, and limitations on use or disclosure of non-public information, among other things. For DCOs and DCMs, the Commission also proposes regulations to implement core principles concerning governance fitness standards and the composition of governing bodies. Finally, for publicly-traded DCMs, the Commission proposes regulations to implement the core principle on diversity of Boards of Directors. The Commission welcomes comments on all aspects of the proposed regulations.

Risk Management Requirements for Derivatives Clearing Organizations
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is proposing regulations to implement Title VII and Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Proposed regulations would establish the regulatory standards for compliance with derivatives clearing organization (DCO) Core Principles C (Participant and Product Eligibility), D (Risk Management), E (Settlement Procedures), F (Treatment of Funds), G (Default Rules and Procedures), and I (System Safeguards). For DCOs that are designated by the Financial Stability Oversight Council as systemically important DCOs (SIDCOs), the Commission is proposing heightened standards in the area of system safeguards supporting business continuity and disaster recovery and a provision that would implement the Commission's special enforcement authority over SIDCOs. The Commission also is proposing certain additional amendments including replacement of the current part 39 appendix A, Application Guidance and Compliance With Core Principles, with an application form for entities seeking to register as DCOs, technical amendments to reorganize part 39 of the Commission's regulations, and amendments to supplement reporting and public information requirements proposed in a previous rulemaking.

Position Limits for Derivatives
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (``Dodd-Frank Act'') requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') to establish position limits for certain physical commodity derivatives. The Commission is proposing to simultaneously establish position limits and limit formulas for certain physical commodity futures and option contracts executed pursuant to the rules of designated contract markets (``DCM'') and physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such DCM contracts. In compliance with the requirements of the Dodd- Frank Act, the CFTC is also proposing aggregate position limits that would apply across different trading venues to contracts based on the same underlying commodity. The Commission is proposing to establish position limits in two phases: The first phase would involve adopting current DCM spot-month limits, while the second phase would involve establishing non-spot-month limits based on open interest levels as well as establishing Commission-determined spot-month limits. The proposal includes exemptions for bona fide hedging transactions and for positions that are established in good faith prior to the effective date of specific limits that could be adopted pursuant to final regulations. This notice of rulemaking also proposes new account aggregation standards, visibility regulations that are similar to current reporting obligations for large bona fide hedgers, and new regulations establishing requirements and standards for position limits and accountability rules that are implemented by registered entities. The Commission solicits comment on any aspect of the proposal. The Commission also solicits comment on particular issues throughout the preamble.

76 FR 5973
Commodity Options and Agricultural Swaps
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is charged with proposing rules to implement new statutory provisions enacted by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). The Dodd-Frank Act provides that swaps in an agricultural commodity (as defined by the Commission) are prohibited unless entered into pursuant to a rule, regulation or order of the Commission adopted pursuant to Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act''). The Dodd-Frank Act also includes options (other than an option on a futures contract) in its definition of swaps. Broadly speaking, the rules proposed herein would implement regulations whereby swaps in agricultural commodities and all commodity options (including options on both agricultural and non-agricultural commodities), other than options on futures, may transact subject to the same rules as all other swaps. The proposed rules for swaps in an agricultural commodity would repeal and replace the Commission's regulations concerning the exemption of swap agreements. Because the Dodd-Frank Act defines commodity options (other than options on futures) as swaps, the proposed rules for options would substantially amend the Commission's regulations regarding commodity option transactions. Also, current regulations on domestic exchange-traded commodity option transactions applies not only to exchange-traded options on futures (which are excluded from the Dodd-Frank definition of a swap), but also to exchange-traded options on physical commodities (which are within the Dodd-Frank swap definition). Therefore, the proposed rules would remove references to options on physical commodities from the Commission's regulations for exchange-traded options on futures.

Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF

The proposed SEC rule would require investment advisers registered with the SEC that advise one or more private funds to file Form PF with the SEC. The proposed CFTC rule would require commodity pool operators (``CPOs'') and commodity trading advisors (``CTAs'') registered with the CFTC to satisfy certain proposed CFTC filing requirements by filing Form PF with the SEC, but only if those CPOs and CTAs are also registered with the SEC as investment advisers and advise one or more private funds. The information contained in Form PF is designed, among other things, to assist the Financial Stability Oversight Council in its assessment of systemic risk in the U.S. financial system. These advisers would file these reports electronically, on a confidential basis.

Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing regulations to implement new statutory provisions enacted by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). The proposed regulations would implement the new statutory framework of Section 4s(e) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), added by Section 731 of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires the Commission to adopt capital and initial and variation margin requirements for certain swap dealers (``SDs'') and major swap participants (``MSPs''). The proposed rules address initial and variation margin requirements for SDs and MSPs. The proposed rules will not impose margin requirements on non-financial end users. The Commission will propose rules regarding capital requirements for SDs and MSPs at a later date. The Commission will align the comment periods of these two proposals so that commenters will have an opportunity to review each before commenting on either.

Reopening and Extension of Comment Periods for Rulemakings Implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
Since the enactment of the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') on July 21, 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') has published in the Federal Register a significant number of notices of proposed rulemaking to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act that establish a comprehensive new framework for the regulation of swaps. In order to provide interested parties with an additional opportunity to participate in these Dodd-Frank Act rulemakings and comment on the proposed new regulatory framework, the Commission is reopening or extending the comment period for many of its proposed rulemakings. The Commission is also requesting comment on the order in which it should consider final rulemakings made under the Dodd-Frank Act.

Margin Requirements for Uncleared Swaps for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants
On April 28, 2011, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking that would establish initial and variation margin requirements for swap dealers (SDs) and major swap participants (MSPs). Elsewhere today in the Federal Register, the Commission is proposing to adopt capital, financial reporting, and recordkeeping requirements for these same entities, as well as proposing to amend certain capital requirements for futures commission merchants (FCMs) that also register as SDs or MSPs and supplemental capital requirements, and supplemental financial reporting requirements for these FCMs. The Commission now is extending the comment period for the proposed margin regulations so that the comment period will run concurrently with the comment period for the proposed rulemaking on capital requirements being published today.

Capital Requirements of Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is proposing regulations that would implement the new statutory framework in the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA), added by the Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). These new provisions of the CEA require, among other things, the Commission to adopt capital requirements for certain swap dealers (SDs) and major swap participants (MSPs). The proposed rules also provide for related financial condition reporting and recordkeeping by SDs and MSPs. The Commission further proposes to amend existing capital and financial reporting regulations for futures commission merchants (FCMs) that also register as SDs or MSPs. The proposed regulations also include requirements for supplemental FCM financial reporting to reflect section 724 of the Dodd-Frank Act. In order to align the comment periods for this proposed rule and the Commission's earlier proposed rulemaking on margin requirements for uncleared swaps,\1\ the comment period for the proposed margin rulemaking is being extended elsewhere in the Federal Register today, so that commenters will have the opportunity to review the proposed capital and margin rules together before the expiration of the comment periods for either proposed rule. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commodity Pool Operators: Relief From Compliance With Certain Disclosure, Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Registered CPOs of Commodity Pools Listed for Trading on a National Securities Exchange; CPO Registration Exemption for Certain Independent Directors or Trustees of These Commodity Pools
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is adopting amendments to its regulations as they affect certain commodity pool operators (CPOs) of commodity pools whose units of participation are listed and traded on a national securities exchange (Amendments). Specifically, this action codifies the relief from certain disclosure, reporting, and recordkeeping requirements that Commission staff previously had issued to these CPOs on a case-by-case basis. It also codifies relief from the CPO registration requirement for certain independent directors or trustees of actively-managed commodity pools that Commission staff similarly has issued.

Adaptation of Regulations to Incorporate Swaps
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'' or ``DFA'') established a comprehensive new statutory framework for swaps and security-based swaps. The Dodd-Frank Act repeals some sections of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act''), amends others, and adds a number of new provisions. The DFA also requires the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or ``Commission'') to promulgate a number of rules to implement the new framework. The Commission has proposed numerous rules to satisfy its obligations under the DFA. Because the Dodd-Frank Act makes so many changes to the existing statutory and regulatory frameworks, the proposed rules would make a number of conforming changes to the CFTC's regulations to integrate them more fully with the new statutory and regulatory framework (``Proposal'').

Effective Date for Swap Regulation
Pursuant to section 754 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''), the general effective date for certain provisions of subtitle A of title VII of the Dodd- Frank Act (``Title VII'') that do not require a rulemaking is 360 days after enactment, or July 16, 2011, unless another effective date is specifically provided. Following the general effective date, market participants may be subject to certain Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act'') requirements but not others. To provide greater clarity regarding the applicability of various statutory and regulatory requirements, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or the ``Commission'') is proposing to grant, pursuant to its section 4(c) exemptive authority, temporary relief in two parts with respect to various requirements of the CEA that apply or may apply to certain agreements, contracts, and transactions. In part one, the Commission is proposing to temporarily exempt persons or entities with respect to provisions of the CEA added or amended by the Dodd-Frank Act that reference one or more terms regarding entities or instruments that Title VII requires be ``further defined,'' such as the terms ``swap,'' ``swap dealer,'' ``major swap participant,'' or ``eligible contract participant,'' to the extent that requirements or portions of such provisions specifically relate to such referenced terms. In part two, the Commission is proposing to grant relief from certain provisions of the CEA that will or may apply to certain agreements, contracts, and transactions in exempt or excluded commodities as a result of the repeal of various CEA exemptions and exclusions as of July 16, 2011.

Agricultural Swaps
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is charged with proposing rules to implement new statutory provisions enacted by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). The Dodd-Frank Act provides that swaps in an agricultural commodity (as defined by the Commission) are prohibited unless entered into pursuant to a rule, regulation or order of the Commission adopted pursuant to certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act''). On February 3, 2011, the Commission requested comment on a set of proposed rules that would, among other things, implement regulations whereby swaps in agricultural commodities may transact subject to the same rules as all other swaps. The proposed rules for swaps in an agricultural commodity would repeal and replace the Commission's current regulations concerning the exemption of swap agreements. After reviewing the comments submitted in response to the proposed rules, the Commission has determined to issue these final rules for swaps in an agricultural commodity in the form as originally proposed. The February 3, 2011, proposed rules also included provisions that would substantially amend the Commission's regulations regarding commodity option transactions. However, in this final rule the Commission is only issuing the rules for swaps in an agricultural commodity. The proposed rules for commodity option transactions will be addressed at a later date.

Whistleblower Incentives and Protection
The Commission is adopting Final Rules and new forms to implement Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act'') entitled ``Commodity Whistleblower Incentives and Protection.'' The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on July 21, 2010 (``Dodd-Frank Act''), established a whistleblower program that requires the Commission to pay an award, under regulations prescribed by the Commission and subject to certain limitations, to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about a violation of the CEA that leads to the successful enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action, or a related action. The Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits retaliation by employers against individuals who provide the Commission with information about possible CEA violations.

Effective Date for Swap Regulation
On July 14, 2011, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or the ``Commission'') issued a final order (``July 14 Order'') that grants temporary exemptive relief from certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') that otherwise would have taken effect on the general effective date of title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``the Dodd-Frank Act'')--July 16, 2011. The July 14 Order grants temporary relief in two parts. The first part addresses those CEA provisions added or amended by title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act that reference one or more terms regarding entities or instruments that title VII requires be ``further defined'' to the extent that requirements or portions of such provisions specifically relate to such referenced terms and do not require a rulemaking. The second part, which is based on part 35 of the Commission's regulations, addresses certain provisions of the CEA that may apply to certain agreements, contracts, and transactions in exempt or excluded commodities as a result of the repeal of various CEA exemptions and exclusions as of the general effective date of July 16, 2011. This is a notice of a proposed amendment to that July 14 Order, 76 FR 42508 (July 19, 2011), that would modify the temporary exemptive relief provided therein by extending the potential latest expiration date of the July 14 Order; and adding provisions to account for the repeal and replacement (as of December 31, 2011) of part 35 of the Commission's regulations. Only comments pertaining to these proposed amendments to the July 14 Order will be considered as part of this notice of proposed amendment.

Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') (collectively, ``we'' or the ``Commissions'') are adopting new rules under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to implement provisions of Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The new SEC rule requires investment advisers registered with the SEC that advise one or more private funds and have at least $150 million in private fund assets under management to file Form PF with the SEC. The new CFTC rule requires commodity pool operators (``CPOs'') and commodity trading advisors (``CTAs'') registered with the CFTC to satisfy certain CFTC filing requirements with respect to private funds, should the CFTC adopt such requirements, by filing Form PF with the SEC, but only if those CPOs and CTAs are also registered with the SEC as investment advisers and are required to file Form PF under the Advisers Act. The new CFTC rule also allows such CPOs and CTAs to satisfy certain CFTC filing requirements with respect to commodity pools that are not private funds, should the CFTC adopt such requirements, by filing Form PF with the SEC. Advisers must file Form PF electronically, on a confidential basis. The information contained in Form PF is designed, among other things, to assist the Financial Stability Oversight Council in its assessment of systemic risk in the U.S. financial system.

Prohibitions and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Interests in, and Relationships With, Hedge Funds and Covered Funds
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or ``Commission'') is requesting comment on a proposed rule that would implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') which contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ``Board'') to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (``CFTC Rule''). On November 7, 2011, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Treasury (``OCC''); the Board; the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''); and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') published a joint proposed rule implementing Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (the ``Joint Release'').\1\ The CFTC is adopting the entire text of the proposed common rules section from the Joint Release (the ``Joint Rule'') as part of its proposed rule.\2\ Similar to the OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the SEC in the Joint Release, the CFTC is modifying the Joint Rule with CFTC-specific rule text. The CFTC Rule also contains additional questions specific to the CFTC in Section III and does not include Subpart E of the Joint Release because Subpart E deals exclusively with the Board. The Commission solicits comments on all aspects of this proposed rule. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identity Theft Red Flags Rules
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC,'' together with the CFTC, the ``Commissions'') are jointly issuing proposed rules and guidelines to implement new statutory provisions enacted by Title X of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These provisions amend section 615(e) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and direct the Commissions to prescribe rules requiring entities that are subject to the Commissions' jurisdiction to address identity theft in two ways. First, the proposed rules and guidelines would require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The Commissions also are proposing guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of a program that would satisfy the requirements of the proposed rules. Second, the proposed rules would establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the Commissions' jurisdiction, to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances.

Swap Dealer and Major Swap Participant Recordkeeping, Reporting, and Duties Rules; Futures Commission Merchant and Introducing Broker Conflicts of Interest Rules; and Chief Compliance Officer Rules for Swap Dealers, Major Swap Participants, and Futures Commission Merchants
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission or CFTC) is adopting regulations to implement certain provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd- Frank Act). These regulations set forth reporting and recordkeeping requirements and daily trading records requirements for swap dealers (SDs) and major swap participants (MSPs).

In addition, these regulations establish conflicts-of- interest requirements for SDs, MSPs, futures commission merchants (FCMs), and introducing brokers (IBs) with regard to firewalls between research and trading and between clearing and trading. Finally, these regulations also require each FCM, SD, and MSP to designate a chief compliance officer, prescribe qualifications and duties of the chief compliance officer, and require that the chief compliance officer prepare, certify, and furnish to the Commission an annual report containing an assessment of the registrant's compliance activities.

Only comments pertaining to the interim final rule will be considered in any further action related to these rules.

Second Amendment to July 14, 2011 Order for Swap Regulation
On July 14, 2011, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or the ``Commission'') issued a final order (``July 14 Order'') that granted temporary exemptive relief from certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') that otherwise would have taken effect on the general effective date of title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd- Frank Act'')--July 16, 2011. On December 23, 2011, the Commission amended the July 14 Order to extend the potential latest expiration date of the July 14 Order from December 31, 2011 to July 16, 2012, and added provisions to account for the repeal and replacement (as of December 31, 2011) of part 35 of the Commission's regulations (the ``First Amended July 14 Order''). In this Notice of Proposed Amendment (``Notice''), the Commission proposes to further modify the temporary exemptive relief provided in the First Amended July 14 Order by: (1) Removing references to the entities terms, including ``swap dealer,'' ``major swap participant,'' and ``eligible contract participant'' in light of the final, joint CFTC-SEC rulemaking further defining them issued on April 18, 2012; (2) extending the potential latest expiration date of the July 14 Order to December 31, 2012, or, depending on the nature of the relief, such other compliance date as may be determined by the Commission; (3) allowing the clearing of agricultural swaps, as described herein; and (4) removing any reference to the exempt commercial market (``ECM'') and exempt board of trade (``EBOT'') grandfather relief previously issued by the Commission. Only comments pertaining to these proposed amendments to the First Amended July 14 Order, as amended (the ``Second Amended July 14 Order''), will be considered.

Specifically, this proposed interpretive guidance and policy statement describes the following: The general manner in which the Commission will consider whether a person's swap dealing activities or swap positions may require registration as a swap dealer or major swap participant, respectively, and the application of the related requirements under the CEA to swaps involving such persons; and the application of the clearing, trade execution, and certain reporting and recordkeeping provisions under the CEA, to cross-border swaps involving one or more counterparties that are not swap dealers or major swap participants. This proposed interpretive guidance and policy statement also generally describes the policy and procedural framework under which the Commission may permit compliance with a comparable regulatory requirement of a foreign jurisdiction to substitute for compliance with the requirements of the CEA.

BCBS and IOSCO recently published a consultative paper prepared by the WGMR that outlines possible margin requirements for non-centrally cleared derivatives (``consultative paper'').\2\ The Commission is extending the comment period for its proposed margin rules for uncleared swaps for swap dealers and major swap participants in order to give interested parties the opportunity to comment on the consultative paper and the CFTC's proposed rules concurrently. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Exemptive Order Regarding Compliance With Certain Swap Regulations
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') is proposing to grant, pursuant to section 4(c) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''), temporary exemptive relief in order to allow non-U.S. swap dealers and non-U.S. major swap participants to delay compliance with certain entity-level requirements of the CEA (and Commission regulations promulgated thereunder), subject to specified conditions. Additionally, with respect to transaction-level requirements of the CEA (and Commission regulations promulgated thereunder), the relief would allow non-U.S. swap dealers and non-U.S. major swap participants, as well as foreign branches of U.S. swap dealers and major swap participants, to comply only with those requirements as may be required in the home jurisdiction of such non-U.S. swap dealers and non-U.S. major swap participants (or in the case of foreign branches of a U.S. swap dealer or U.S. major swap participant, the foreign location of the branch) for swaps with non-U.S. counterparties. This relief would become effective concurrently with the date upon which swap dealers and major swap participants must first apply for registration and expire 12 months following the publication of this proposed order in the Federal Register. Finally, U.S. swap dealers and U.S. major swap participants may delay compliance with certain entity-level requirements of the CEA (and Commission regulations promulgated thereunder) from the date upon which swap dealers and major swap participants must apply for registration until January 1, 2013.

Second Amendment to July 14, 2011 Order for Swap Regulation
On May 16, 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or the ``Commission'') published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Amendment (``Notice'') to extend the temporary exemptive relief the Commission granted on July 14, 2011 (``July 14 Order'') from certain provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'') that otherwise would have taken effect on the general effective date of title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``the Dodd-Frank Act'')--July 16, 2011. This final order extends the July 14 Order with certain modifications. Specifically, it removes references to the entities terms, including ``swap dealer,'' ``major swap participant,'' and ``eligible contract participant'' in light of the final joint rulemaking of the CFTC and Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') further defining those terms issued on April 18, 2012; extends the potential latest expiration date of the July 14 Order to December 31, 2012, or, depending on the nature of the relief, such other compliance date as may be determined by the Commission; allows the clearing of agricultural swaps, as described herein; and removes any reference to the exempt commercial market (``ECM'') and exempt board of trade (``EBOT'') grandfather relief previously issued by the Commission.

Privacy Act of 1974 System of Records Notice
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (Commission) is revising one system of records under the Privacy Act of 1974: CFTC-44, Personnel Security Files, to be renamed CFTC-44, Personnel Clearance System. The Commission also is establishing two new systems of records: CFTC-48, Personal Property Claims, and CFTC-49, Whistleblower Records (Exempted). Revisions to CFTC-44 incorporate enhancements to the system of records with a new streamlined process of capturing personal information, minimizing paper records and eliminating manual entry into a legacy application when an individual applies for a security clearance. New CFTC-48 addresses information collected through a new process for employees to file and have adjudicated claims for damage or loss of certain personal property, as stated in Commission policies and applicable law. New CFTC-49 addresses information collected for the Commission's whistleblower program, which is described and defined in Section 23 of the Commodity Exchange Act, 7 U.S.C. 26, and the rules promulgated thereunder, 17 CFR part 165.

The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') is proposing new rules and related forms to enhance its identification of futures and swap market participants. The proposed rules would leverage the Commission's existing position and transaction reporting programs by requiring the electronic submission of trader identification and market participant data on amended Forms 102 and 40, and on new Form 71. The proposed rules also incorporate a revised approach to the Commission's previous initiative to collect ownership and control information, through a dedicated ownership and control report (``OCR''), for trading accounts active on reporting markets that are designated contract markets or swap execution facilities. The Commission welcomes public comment on all aspects of its proposal.

Clearing Exemption for Swaps Between Certain Affiliated Entities
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or ``Commission'') is proposing a rule to exempt swaps between certain affiliated entities within a corporate group from the clearing requirement (the ``inter-affiliate clearing exemption'' or the ``proposed exemption'') under Section 2(h)(1)(A) of the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA''). The Commission also is proposing rules that detail specific conditions counterparties must satisfy to elect the proposed inter-affiliate clearing exemption, as well as reporting requirements for affiliated entities that avail themselves of the proposed exemption. The Commission has finalized a rule that addresses swaps that are subject to the end-user exception. Counterparties to inter-affiliate swaps that qualify for the end-user exception would be able to elect to not clear swaps pursuant to the end-user exception or the proposed rule. The proposed rule does not address swaps that an affiliate enters into with a third party that are related to inter- affiliate swaps that are subject to the end-user exception. The Commission intends separately to propose a rule addressing swaps between an affiliate and a third party where the swaps are used to hedge or mitigate commercial risk arising from inter-affiliate swaps for which the end-user exception has been elected.

Identity Theft Red Flags Rules
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') (together, the ``Commissions'') are jointly issuing final rules and guidelines to require certain regulated entities to establish programs to address risks of identity theft. These rules and guidelines implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and directed the Commissions to adopt rules requiring entities that are subject to the Commissions' respective enforcement authorities to address identity theft. First, the rules require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The rules include guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of programs that would satisfy the requirements of the rules. Second, the rules establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the Commissions' respective enforcement authorities, to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances.

Concept Release on Risk Controls and System Safeguards for Automated Trading Environments
U.S. derivatives markets have experienced a fundamental transition from human-centered trading venues to highly automated and interconnected trading environments. The operational centers of modern markets now reside in a combination of automated trading systems (``ATSs'') and electronic trading platforms that can execute repetitive tasks at speeds orders of magnitude greater than any human equivalent. Traditional risk controls and safeguards that relied on human judgment and speeds, and which were appropriate to manual and/or floor-based trading environments, must be reevaluated in light of new market structures. Further, the Commission and market participants must ensure that regulatory standards and internal controls are calibrated to match both current and foreseeable market technologies and risks. This Concept Release on Risk Controls and System Safeguards for Automated Trading Environments (``Concept Release'') reflects the Commission's continuing commitment to the safety and soundness of U.S. derivatives markets in a time of rapid technological change. The Concept Release serves as a platform for cataloguing existing industry practices, determining their efficacy and implementation to date, and evaluating the need for additional measures, if any. The Commission welcomes all public comments.

Specifically, the final rule contained herein imposes requirements on swap dealers (``SDs'') and major swap participants (``MSPs'') with respect to the treatment of collateral posted by their counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure uncleared swaps. Additionally, the final rule includes revisions to ensure that, for purposes of subchapter IV of chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, securities held in a portfolio margining account that is a futures account or a Cleared Swaps Customer Account constitute ``customer property''; and owners of such account constitute ``customers.''

Aggregation of Positions
On May 30, 2012, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'' or ``CFTC'') published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed modifications to part 151 of the Commission's regulations. The modifications addressed the policy for aggregation under the Commission's position limits regime for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts. In an Order dated September 28, 2012, the District Court for the District of Columbia vacated part 151 of the Commission's regulations. The Commission is now proposing modifications to the aggregation provisions of part 150 of the Commission's regulations that are substantially similar to the aggregation modifications proposed to part 151, except that the modifications address the policy for aggregation under the Commission's position limits regime for futures and option contracts on nine agricultural commodities set forth in part 150. Separately, the Commission is also proposing today to establish speculative position limits for the 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts that previously had been covered by part 151 of its regulations. If both proposals are finalized, the modifications proposed here to the aggregation provisions of part 150 would apply to the position limits regimes for both the futures and option contracts on nine agricultural commodities and the 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts. However, the Commission may determine to adopt the modifications proposed here separately from any other amendment to the position limits regime.

Position Limits for Derivatives
The Commission proposes to amend regulations concerning speculative position limits to conform to the Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 (``Dodd-Frank Act'') amendments to the Commodity Exchange Act (``CEA'' or ``Act''). The Commission proposes to establish speculative position limits for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and option contracts, and physical commodity swaps that are ``economically equivalent'' to such contracts. In connection with establishing these limits, the Commission proposes to update some relevant definitions; revise the exemptions from speculative position limits, including for bona fide hedging; and extend and update reporting requirements for persons claiming exemption from these limits. The Commission proposes appendices that would provide guidance on risk management exemptions for commodity derivative contracts in excluded commodities permitted under the proposed definition of bona fide hedging position; list core referenced futures contracts and commodities that would be substantially the same as a commodity underlying a core referenced futures contract for purposes of the proposed definition of basis contract; describe and analyze fourteen fact patterns that would satisfy the proposed definition of bona fide hedging position; and present the proposed speculative position limit levels in tabular form. In addition, the Commission proposes to update certain of its rules, guidance and acceptable practices for compliance with Designated Contract Market (``DCM'') core principle 5 and Swap Execution Facility (``SEF'') core principle 6 in respect of exchange- set speculative position limits and position accountability levels.

On November 15, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the ``Aggregation Proposal'') to amend existing regulations setting out the Commission's policy for aggregation under its position limits regime. On the same day that the Commission adopted the Aggregation Proposal, it also adopted a proposal to establish speculative position limits for the 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts that previously had been covered by part 151 of its regulations (the ``Position Limits Proposal''). However, the Position Limits Proposal was not published in the Federal Register until December 12, 2013. Because the comment period for both proposals was 60 days after publication in the Federal Register, the comment period for the Position Limits Proposal runs to a later date than the comment period for the Aggregation Proposal. In order to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the Aggregation Proposal for so long as the comment period on the Position Limits Proposal is open, the Commission is extending the comment period for the Aggregation Proposal so that it ends at the same time as the comment period for the Position Limits Proposal.

Prohibitions and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Interests in, and Relationships with, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'' or ``Commission'') is adopting a final rule to implement Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), which contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the ``Board'') to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund. Section 619 also requires the Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Securities and Exchange Commission to also issue regulations implementing section 619 and directs the CFTC and those four agencies to consult and coordinate with each other, as appropriate, in developing and issuing the implementing rules, for the purposes of assuring, to the extent possible, that such rules are comparable and provide for consistent application and implementation. To that end, although the Commission is adopting a final rule that is not a joint rule with the other agencies, the CFTC and the other agencies have worked closely together to develop the same rule text and supplementary information, except for information specific to the CFTC or the other agencies, as applicable. In particular, the CFTC's final rule is numbered as part 75 of the Commission's regulations, the rule text refers to the ``Commission'' instead of the ``[Agency]'' and one section of the regulations addresses authority, purpose, scope, and relationship to other authorities with respect to the Commission. Furthermore, it is noted that the supplementary information generally refers to the ``Agencies'' collectively when referring to deliberations and considerations in developing the final rule by the CFTC together with the other four agencies and references to the ``final rule'' should be deemed to refer to the final rule of the Commission as herein adopted.

Position Limits for Derivatives and Aggregation of Positions
On December 12, 2013, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``Commission'') published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the ``Position Limits Proposal'') to establish speculative position limits for 28 exempt and agricultural commodity futures and options contracts and the physical commodity swaps that are economically equivalent to such contracts. On November 15, 2013, the Commission published in the Federal Register a notice of proposed rulemaking (the ``Aggregation Proposal'') to amend existing regulations setting out the Commission's policy for aggregation under its position limits regime. The Commission has directed staff to hold a public roundtable on June 19, 2014, to consider certain issues regarding position limits for physical commodity derivatives. In order to provide interested parties with an opportunity to comment on the issues to be discussed at the roundtable, the Commission will reopen the comment periods for the Position Limits Proposal and the Aggregation Proposal for a three-week period starting June 12, 2014 (one week before the roundtable) and ending July 3, 2014 (two weeks following the roundtable). Comments should be limited to the issues of hedges of a physical commodity by a commercial enterprise, including gross hedging, cross- commodity hedging, anticipatory hedging, and the process for obtaining a non-enumerated exemption; the setting of spot month limits in physical-delivery and cash-settled contracts and a conditional spot- month limit exemption; the setting of non-spot limits for wheat contracts; the aggregation exemption for certain ownership interests of greater than 50 percent in an owned entity; and aggregation based on substantially identical trading strategies.

Enhancing Protections Afforded Customers and Customer Funds Held by Futures Commission Merchants and Derivatives Clearing Organizations; Correction
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') is correcting final rules published in the Federal Register of November 14, 2013 (``final rules''). Those rules, which adopted new regulations and amended existing regulations requiring enhanced customer protections, risk management programs, internal monitoring and controls, capital and liquidity standards, customer disclosures, and auditing and examination programs for futures commission merchants, took effect on January 13, 2014. This correction amends erroneous cross-references found in three sections of the final rules. Additionally, this correction amends one section of the final rules to insert language that was in the proposed rulemaking, and which was stated as being adopted in the preamble to the final rules, but was erroneously omitted from the final rule text.
