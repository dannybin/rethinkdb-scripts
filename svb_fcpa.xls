Regulation SBSR-Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information
In accordance with Section 763 (``Section 763'') and Section 766 (``Section 766'') of Title VII (``Title VII'') of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is proposing Regulation SBSR--Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information (``Regulation SBSR'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'').\1\ Proposed Regulation SBSR would provide for the reporting of security- based swap information to registered security-based swap data repositories or the Commission and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information. Registered security-based swap data repositories would be required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered security-based swap data repositories that are security- based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants would be required to establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting obligations. Finally, proposed Regulation SBSR also would require a registered SDR to register with the Commission as a securities information processor on existing Form SIP. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Issuer Review of Assets in Offerings of Asset-Backed Securities
We are adopting new requirements in order to implement Section 945 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ``Act''). We are adopting a new rule under the Securities Act of 1933 to require any issuer registering the offer and sale of an asset-backed security (``ABS'') to perform a review of the assets underlying the ABS. We also are adopting amendments to Item 1111 of Regulation AB that would require an ABS issuer to disclose the nature of its review of the assets and the findings and conclusions of the issuer's review of the assets.

Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protections
The Commission is adopting rules and forms to implement Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') entitled ``Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protection.'' The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on July 21, 2010 (``Dodd-Frank''), established a whistleblower program that requires the Commission to pay an award, under regulations prescribed by the Commission and subject to certain limitations, to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about a violation of the Federal securities laws that leads to the successful enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action, or a related action. Dodd-Frank also prohibits retaliation by employers against individuals who provide the Commission with information about possible securities violations.

CCC Export Credit Guarantee (GSM-102) Program
This proposed rule would revise and amend the regulations that administer the Export Credit Guarantee (GSM-102) Program. Changes in this proposed rule incorporate program operational changes and information from press releases and notices to participants that have been implemented since the publication of the current rule, and include other administrative revisions to enhance clarity and program integrity. These changes should increase program availability to all participants and enhance access and encourage sales for smaller U.S. exporters. The proposed rule would eliminate provisions for the Intermediate Export Credit Guarantee (GSM-103) Program, consistent with the repeal of authority to operate this program in the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (2008 Act).

Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers
We are adopting new rules and an amendment to a new form pursuant to Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers. Section 1504 added Section 13(q) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires the Commission to issue rules requiring resource extraction issuers to include in an annual report information relating to any payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or an entity under the control of the issuer, to a foreign government or the Federal Government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. Section 13(q) requires a resource extraction issuer to provide information about the type and total amount of such payments made for each project related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals, and the type and total amount of payments made to each government. In addition, Section 13(q) requires a resource extraction issuer to provide information regarding those payments in an interactive data format.
