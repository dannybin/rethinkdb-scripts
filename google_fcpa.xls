Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption; Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000; Accreditation of Agencies; Approval of Persons
The Department of State (the Department) is issuing a final rule on the accreditation and approval of agencies and persons in accordance with the 1993 Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (the Convention) and the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (the IAA), after review of public comments received in response to the Department's September 15, 2003 issuance of a proposed rule. The Convention and the IAA generally require that agencies and persons be accredited or approved to provide adoption services for intercountry adoptions when both countries involved are parties to the Convention, and the IAA requires that the Department designate one or more qualified accrediting entities to accredit and approve agencies and persons. Today's new action establishes the accreditation and approval standards for agencies and persons that accrediting entities will use; establishes requirements applicable to potential accrediting entities; and establishes a framework for the Department's oversight of accrediting entities, agencies, and persons. This action is a necessary step toward bringing the Convention into force for the United States.

Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We are proposing interpretive guidance for management regarding its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. The interpretive guidance sets forth an approach by which management can conduct a top-down, risk-based evaluation of internal control over financial reporting. The proposed guidance is intended to assist companies of all sizes to complete their annual evaluation in an effective and efficient manner and it provides guidance on a number of areas commonly cited as concerns over the past two years. In addition, we are proposing an amendment to our rules requiring management's annual evaluation of internal control over financial reporting to make it clear that an evaluation that complies with the interpretive guidance is one way to satisfy those rules. Further, we are proposing an amendment to our rules to revise the requirements regarding the auditor's attestation report on the assessment of internal control over financial reporting.

Revisions and Clarification of Export and Reexport Controls for the People's Republic of China (PRC); New Authorization Validated End-User; Revision of Import Certificate and PRC End-User Statement Requirements
In this final rule, the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) amends the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) to revise and clarify U.S. licensing requirements and licensing policy on exports and reexports of items to the People's Republic of China (PRC). BIS published a revised policy and related amendments in proposed form in the Federal Register with a request for comments. This final rule establishes a control, based on knowledge of a ``military end-use,'' on exports and reexports to the PRC of certain items on the Commerce Control List (CCL) that otherwise do not require a license to the PRC. It also includes a revision to the license application review policy for items destined for the PRC that are controlled on the CCL for reasons of national security, and revises the license review policy for items controlled for reasons of chemical and biological weapons proliferation, nuclear nonproliferation, and missile technology for export to the PRC, requiring that applications involving such items be reviewed in conjunction with the revised national security licensing policy. This rule also creates a new authorization for ``validated end-users'' to which specified items may be exported or reexported without a license. Validated end-users will be placed on a list in the EAR after review and approval by the United States Government. The process for such review is also set forth in this final rule. This rule also revises the circumstances in which End-User Statements, issued by the PRC Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM), must be obtained, requiring them for transactions that both require a license to the PRC for any reason and (for most exports) exceed a total value of $50,000. This final rule also includes other minor corrections and conforming amendments.

In accordance with Section 763 (``Section 763'') and Section 766 (``Section 766'') of Title VII (``Title VII'') of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is proposing Regulation SBSR--Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information (``Regulation SBSR'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'').\1\ Proposed Regulation SBSR would provide for the reporting of security- based swap information to registered security-based swap data repositories or the Commission and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information. Registered security-based swap data repositories would be required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered security-based swap data repositories that are security- based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants would be required to establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting obligations. Finally, proposed Regulation SBSR also would require a registered SDR to register with the Commission as a securities information processor on existing Form SIP. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dodd-Frank also prohibits retaliation by employers against individuals who provide the Commission with information about possible securities violations.

Section 13(q) requires a resource extraction issuer to provide information about the type and total amount of such payments made for each project related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals, and the type and total amount of payments made to each government. In addition, Section 13(q) requires a resource extraction issuer to provide information regarding those payments in an interactive data format.
