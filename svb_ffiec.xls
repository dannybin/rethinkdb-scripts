75 FR 36270
Description of Office, Procedures, and Public Information
The Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (Council or FFIEC), on behalf of its members, is proposing to update its Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) regulations. The Council last made changes to its FOIA regulations in 1988. Since that time information relating to the Council has changed and there have been several amendments to the FOIA, which need to be reflected in the regulations. The proposed rules revise the procedures to be used by members of the public in requesting records maintained by the Council, the time limits in which the Council must make a determination on disclosure in response to a request for records, the time period in which a requester has the right to administratively appeal any adverse determination made on a request for records, and provides procedures to be used to request expedited processing of FOIA requests. The revisions in the proposed rules are designed to improve access to records maintained by the Council and to provide clearer guidance to requesters on how to obtain records under the FOIA.
