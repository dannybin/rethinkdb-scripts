Temporary Rule Regarding Principal Trades With Certain Advisory Clients
On December 30, 2009, the Securities and Exchange Commission published a Federal Register document adopting as final Rule 206(3)-3T under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, the interim final temporary rule that establishes an alternative means for investment advisers who are registered with the Commission as broker-dealers to meet the requirements of Section 206(3) of the Investment Advisers Act when they act in a principal capacity in transactions with certain of their advisory clients. As adopted, the only change to the rule was the expiration date in paragraph (d) of the section. Rule 206(3)-3T will sunset on December 31, 2010. This document makes a correction to that document.

Custody of Funds or Securities of Clients by Investment Advisers
The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting amendments to the custody and recordkeeping rules under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related forms. The amendments are designed to provide additional safeguards under the Advisers Act when a registered adviser has custody of client funds or securities by requiring such an adviser, among other things: To undergo an annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant to verify client assets; to have the qualified custodian maintaining client funds and securities send account statements directly to the advisory clients; and unless client assets are maintained by an independent custodian (i.e., a custodian that is not the adviser itself or a related person), to obtain, or receive from a related person, a report of the internal controls relating to the custody of those assets from an independent public accountant that is registered with and subject to regular inspection by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. Finally, the amended custody rule and forms will provide the Commission and the public with better information about the custodial practices of registered investment advisers.

Shareholder Approval of Executive Compensation of TARP Recipients
The Commission is adopting amendments to the proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to set forth certain requirements for U.S. registrants subject to Section 111(e) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. Section 111(e) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 requires companies that have received financial assistance under the Troubled Asset Relief Program (``TARP'') to permit a separate shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of executives, as disclosed pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the Commission, during the period in which any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding. The amendments are intended to help implement this requirement by specifying and clarifying it in the context of the Federal proxy rules.

This delegation is intended to conserve Commission resources, enhance the Division's ability to detect violations of the federal securities laws, increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the Division's investigations, and improve the success of the Commission's enforcement actions.

Concept Release on Equity Market Structure
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is conducting a broad review of the current equity market structure. The review includes an evaluation of equity market structure performance in recent years and an assessment of whether market structure rules have kept pace with, among other things, changes in trading technology and practices. To help further its review, the Commission is publishing this concept release to invite public comment on a wide range of market structure issues, including high frequency trading, order routing, market data linkages, and undisplayed, or ``dark,'' liquidity. The Commission intends to use the public's comments to help determine whether regulatory initiatives to improve the current equity market structure are needed and, if so, the specific nature of such initiatives.

Risk Management Controls for Brokers or Dealers With Market Access
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is proposing for comment new Rule 15c3-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') that would require brokers or dealers with access to trading directly on an exchange or alternative trading system (``ATS''), including those providing sponsored or direct market access to customers or other persons, to implement risk management controls and supervisory procedures reasonably designed to manage the financial, regulatory, and other risks of this business activity. Given the increased speed and automation of trading on securities exchanges and ATSs today, and the growing popularity of sponsored or direct market access arrangements where broker-dealers allow customers to trade in those markets electronically using the broker-dealers' market participant identifiers, the Commission is concerned that the various financial and regulatory risks that arise in connection with such access may not be appropriately and effectively controlled by all broker-dealers. The Commission believes it is critical that broker-dealers, which under the current regulatory structure are the only entities that may be members of exchanges and, as a practical matter, constitute the majority of subscribers to ATSs, appropriately control the risks associated with market access, so as not to jeopardize their own financial condition, that of other market participants, the integrity of trading on the securities markets, and the stability of the financial system.

Purchases of Certain Equity Securities by the Issuer and Others
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is proposing amendments to Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), which provides issuers with a ``safe harbor'' from liability for manipulation when they repurchase their common stock in the market in accordance with the Rule's manner, timing, price, and volume conditions. The proposed amendments are intended to clarify and modernize the safe harbor provisions in light of market developments since Rule 10b-18's adoption in 1982.

Amendments to Rules Requiring Internet Availability of Proxy Materials
We are amending rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933 to clarify and provide additional flexibility regarding the format of the Notice of Internet Availability of Proxy Materials that is sent to shareholders and to permit issuers and other soliciting persons to better communicate with shareholders by including explanatory materials regarding the reasons for the use of the notice and access proxy rules and the process of receiving and reviewing proxy materials and voting pursuant to the notice and access proxy rules. The amendments also revise the timeframe for delivering a Notice to shareholders when a soliciting person other than the issuer relies on the notice and access proxy rules and permit mutual funds to accompany the Notice with a summary prospectus.

Proxy Disclosure Enhancements; Correction
We are making technical corrections to amendments to our disclosure rules adopted in Release No. 33-9089 (December 16, 2009), which was published in the Federal Register on December 23, 2009 (74 FR 68334). Specifically, we are correcting Forms 10-Q and 10-K to retain the current numbering of the items appearing in each form to avoid confusion that might otherwise arise from references to the current numbering in professional literature. In addition, we are making three corrections to Form 8-K. We are correcting Form 8-K to add an instruction, which was inadvertently excluded, that corresponds to an instruction contained in Forms 10-Q and 10-K that allows certain wholly-owned subsidiaries to omit the disclosure of shareholder voting results. We also are correcting Form 8-K to amend the regulatory text to make it consistent with the discussion of the amendments to that form contained in Release No. 33-9089.

Money Market Fund Reform
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is adopting amendments to certain rules that govern money market funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The amendments will tighten the risk-limiting conditions of rule 2a-7 by, among other things, requiring funds to maintain a portion of their portfolios in instruments that can be readily converted to cash, reducing the maximum weighted average maturity of portfolio holdings, and improving the quality of portfolio securities; require money market funds to report their portfolio holdings monthly to the Commission; and permit a money market fund that has ``broken the buck'' (i.e., re-priced its securities below $1.00 per share), or is at imminent risk of breaking the buck, to suspend redemptions to allow for the orderly liquidation of fund assets. The amendments are designed to make money market funds more resilient to certain short-term market risks, and to provide greater protections for investors in a money market fund that is unable to maintain a stable net asset value per share.

75 FR 10846
Amendments to Regulation SHO
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting amendments to Regulation SHO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). We are adopting a short sale-related circuit breaker that, if triggered, will impose a restriction on the prices at which securities may be sold short (``short sale price test'' or ``short sale price test restriction''). Specifically, the Rule requires that a trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution or display of a short sale order of a covered security at a price that is less than or equal to the current national best bid if the price of that covered security decreases by 10% or more from the covered security's closing price as determined by the listing market for the covered security as of the end of regular trading hours on the prior day. In addition, the Rule requires that the trading center establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to impose this short sale price test restriction for the remainder of the day and the following day when a national best bid for the covered security is calculated and disseminated on a current and continuing basis by a plan processor pursuant to an effective national market system plan. We believe it is appropriate at this time to adopt a short sale-related circuit breaker because, when triggered, it will prevent short selling, including potentially manipulative or abusive short selling, from driving down further the price of a security that has already experienced a significant intra-day price decline, and will facilitate the ability of long sellers to sell first upon such a decline. This approach establishes a narrowly-tailored Rule that will target only those securities that are experiencing significant intra- day price declines. We believe that addressing short selling in connection with such declines in individual securities will help address erosion of investor confidence in our markets generally. In addition, we are amending Regulation SHO to provide that a broker-dealer may mark certain qualifying sell orders ``short exempt.'' In particular, if the broker-dealer chooses to rely on its own determination that it is submitting the short sale order to the trading center at a price that is above the current national best bid at the time of submission or to rely on an exception specified in the Rule, it must mark the order as ``short exempt.'' This ``short exempt'' marking requirement will aid surveillance by self-regulatory organizations (``SROs'') and the Commission for compliance with the provisions of Rule 201 of Regulation SHO.

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR) Filer Manual to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. Revisions were are being made primarily to support the upgrade of the Mutual Fund Risk/Return Summary Taxonomy, to extend the interactive data/eXtensible Business Reporting Language (``XBRL'') validation requirements to all Exhibit 101 attachments regardless of the taxonomy used, and to make minor updates to the validation and processing of Form D submissions and the amendments of 13F-HR and 13F- NT submission types. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded to support this functionality on April 12, 2010. The filer manual is also being revised to address minor changes previously made in EDGAR. The revisions to the Filer Manual reflect changes within Volume II entitled EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: ``EDGAR Filing,'' Version 14 (April 2010). The updated manual will be incorporated by reference into the Code of Federal Regulations.

Large Trader Reporting System
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing new Rule 13h-1 and Form 13H under Section 13(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to establish a large trader reporting system. The proposal is intended to assist the Commission in identifying and obtaining certain baseline trading information about traders that conduct a substantial amount of trading activity, as measured by volume or market value, in the U.S. securities markets. In essence, a ``large trader'' would be defined as a person whose transactions in NMS securities equal or exceed two million shares or $20 million during any calendar day, or 20 million shares or $200 million during any calendar month. The proposed large trader reporting system is designed to facilitate the Commission's ability to assess the impact of large trader activity on the securities markets, to reconstruct trading activity following periods of unusual market volatility, and to analyze significant market events for regulatory purposes. It also should enhance the Commission's ability to detect and deter fraudulent and manipulative activity and other trading abuses, and should provide the Commission with a valuable source of useful data to study markets and market activity. The proposed identification, recordkeeping, and reporting system would provide the Commission with a mechanism to identify large traders and their affiliates, accounts, and transactions. Specifically, proposed Rule 13h-1 would require large traders to identify themselves to the Commission and make certain disclosures to the Commission on proposed Form 13H. Upon receipt of Form 13H, the Commission would issue a unique identification number to the large trader, which the large trader would then provide to its registered broker-dealers. Registered broker-dealers would be required to maintain transaction records for each large trader, and would be required to report that information to the Commission upon request. In addition, registered broker-dealers would be required to adopt procedures to monitor their customers for activity that would trigger the identification requirements of the proposed rule.

Asset-Backed Securities
We are proposing significant revisions to Regulation AB and other rules regarding the offering process, disclosure and reporting for asset-backed securities. Our proposals would revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool assets. Our proposals also would repeal the current credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for asset-backed issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria that would include, among other things, a requirement that the sponsor retain a portion of each tranche of the securities that are sold and a requirement that the issuer undertake to file Exchange Act reports on an ongoing basis so long as its public securities are outstanding. We also are proposing to require that, with some exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings of asset-backed securities and ongoing Exchange Act reports contain specified asset-level information about each of the assets in the pool. The asset-level information would be provided according to proposed standards and in a tagged data format using extensible Markup Language (XML). In addition, we are proposing to require, along with the prospectus filing, the filing of a computer program of the contractual cash flow provisions expressed as downloadable source code in Python, a commonly used open source interpretive programming language. We are proposing new information requirements for the safe harbors for exempt offerings and resales of asset-backed securities and are also proposing a number of other revisions to our rules applicable to asset-backed securities.

Amendment to Municipal Securities Disclosure
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is adopting amendments to Rule 15c2-12 (``Rule 15c2-12'' or ``Rule'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') relating to municipal securities disclosure. The amendments revise certain requirements regarding the information that a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer acting as an underwriter in a primary offering of municipal securities must reasonably determine that an issuer of municipal securities or an obligated person has undertaken, in a written agreement or contract for the benefit of holders of the issuer's municipal securities, to provide to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (``MSRB''). Specifically, the amendments require a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer to reasonably determine that the issuer or obligated person has agreed to provide notice of specified events in a timely manner not in excess of ten business days after the event's occurrence; amend the list of events for which a notice is to be provided; and modify the events that are subject to a materiality determination before triggering a requirement to provide notice to the MSRB. In addition, the amendments revise an exemption from the Rule for certain offerings of municipal securities with put features (defined below as ``demand securities''). The Commission also is providing interpretive guidance intended to assist municipal securities brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in meeting their obligations under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.

Investment Company Advertising: Target Date Retirement Fund Names and Marketing
The Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing amendments to rule 482 under the Securities Act of 1933 and rule 34b-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that, if adopted, would require a target date retirement fund that includes the target date in its name to disclose the fund's asset allocation at the target date immediately adjacent to the first use of the fund's name in marketing materials. The Commission is also proposing amendments to rule 482 and rule 34b-1 that, if adopted, would require marketing materials for target date retirement funds to include a table, chart, or graph depicting the fund's asset allocation over time, together with a statement that would highlight the fund's final asset allocation. In addition, the Commission is proposing to amend rule 482 and rule 34b-1 to require a statement in marketing materials to the effect that a target date retirement fund should not be selected based solely on age or retirement date, is not a guaranteed investment, and the stated asset allocations may be subject to change. Finally, the Commission is proposing amendments to rule 156 under the Securities Act that, if adopted, would provide additional guidance regarding statements in marketing materials for target date retirement funds and other investment companies that could be misleading. The amendments are intended to provide enhanced information to investors concerning target date retirement funds and reduce the potential for investors to be confused or misled regarding these and other investment companies.

Political Contributions by Certain Investment Advisers
The Securities and Exchange Commission is adopting a new rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that prohibits an investment adviser from providing advisory services for compensation to a government client for two years after the adviser or certain of its executives or employees make a contribution to certain elected officials or candidates. The new rule also prohibits an adviser from providing or agreeing to provide, directly or indirectly, payment to any third party for a solicitation of advisory business from any government entity on behalf of such adviser, unless such third parties are registered broker-dealers or registered investment advisers, in each case themselves subject to pay to play restrictions. Additionally, the new rule prevents an adviser from soliciting from others, or coordinating, contributions to certain elected officials or candidates or payments to political parties where the adviser is providing or seeking government business. The Commission also is adopting rule amendments that require a registered adviser to maintain certain records of the political contributions made by the adviser or certain of its executives or employees. The new rule and rule amendments address ``pay to play'' practices by investment advisers.

Technical Amendment to Rules of Organization; Conduct and Ethics; and Information and Requests
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is making technical amendments to the rule by which authority is delegated to the Director of the Division of Enforcement. The amendments update references to the provision in the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') which authorizes the Commission to issue subpoenas in investigations under the Securities Act, and delete references to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (``PUHCA'').

Concept Release on the U.S. Proxy System
The Commission is publishing this concept release to solicit comment on various aspects of the U.S. proxy system. It has been many years since we conducted a broad review of the system, and we are aware of industry and investor interest in the Commission's consideration of an update to its rules to promote greater efficiency and transparency in the system and enhance the accuracy and integrity of the shareholder vote. Therefore, we seek comment on the proxy system in general, including the various issues raised in this release involving the U.S. proxy system and certain related matters.

Mutual Fund Distribution Fees; Confirmations
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``the Commission'') is proposing a new rule and rule amendments that would replace rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act, the rule that has permitted registered open-end management investment companies (``mutual funds'' or ``funds'') to use fund assets to pay for the cost of promoting sales of fund shares. The new rule and amendments would continue to allow funds to bear promotional costs within certain limits, and would also preserve the ability of funds to provide investors with alternatives for paying sales charges (e.g., at the time of purchase, at the time of redemption, or through a continuing fee charged to fund assets). Unlike the current rule 12b-1 framework, the proposed rules would limit the cumulative sales charges each investor pays, no matter how they are imposed. To help investors make better- informed choices when selecting a fund that imposes sales charges, the Commission is also proposing to require clearer disclosure about all sales charges in fund prospectuses, annual and semi-annual reports to shareholders, and in investor confirmation statements. As part of the new regulatory framework, the Commission is proposing to give funds and their underwriters the option of offering classes of shares that could be sold by dealers with sales charges set at competitively established rates--rates that could better reflect the services offered by the particular intermediary and the value investors place on those services. For funds electing this option, the proposal would provide relief from restrictions that currently limit retail price competition for distribution services. The proposed rule and rule amendments are designed to protect individual investors from paying disproportionate amounts of sales charges in certain share classes, promote investor understanding of fees, eliminate outdated requirements, provide a more appropriate role for fund directors, and allow greater competition among funds and intermediaries in setting sales loads and distribution fees generally.

Delegation of Authority to the Director of Its Division of Enforcement
The Commission is amending its rules to remove a sunset provision from the delegation of authority to the Director of the Division of Enforcement to issue formal orders of investigation. Formal orders designate the enforcement staff authorized to issue subpoenas in connection with investigations under the Federal securities laws. On August 5, 2009, the Commission issued a release authorizing the Division Director to issue such orders for a one-year period beginning on August 11, 2009 and ending on August 11, 2010. The sunset provision was included to permit the Commission to evaluate the Division's use of the delegation and to consider whether extension of the delegation was appropriate.

Definitions Contained in Title VII of Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), provides for the comprehensive regulation of swaps and security-based swaps. Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act (``Title VII''), provides that the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') (collectively, ``the Commissions''), in consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall jointly further define certain key terms (specifically, ``swap'', ``security-based swap'', ``swap dealer'', ``security-based swap dealer'', ``major swap participant'', ``major security-based swap participant'', ``eligible contract participant'', and ``security-based swap agreement''), and shall jointly prescribe regulations regarding ``mixed swaps,'' as that term is used in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. To assist the SEC and CFTC in further defining such terms, the Commissions are issuing this Notice and request for public comment.

Extension of Filing Accommodation for Static Pool Information in Filings With Respect to Asset-Backed Securities
The Commission proposes to further extend the temporary filing accommodation in Rule 312 of Regulation S-T that allows static pool information required to be disclosed in a prospectus of an asset-backed issuer to be provided on an Internet Web site under certain conditions. Under this rule, such information is deemed to be included in the prospectus included in the registration statement for the asset-backed securities. This rule currently applies to filings with respect to asset-backed securities filed on or before December 31, 2010. We propose to amend this rule to extend its application for an additional eighteen months. Under the proposed extension, the rule would apply to filings with respect to asset-backed securities filed on or before June 30, 2012.

Facilitating Shareholder Director Nominations
We are adopting changes to the Federal proxy rules to facilitate the effective exercise of shareholders' traditional State law rights to nominate and elect directors to company boards of directors. The new rules will require, under certain circumstances, a company's proxy materials to provide shareholders with information about, and the ability to vote for, a shareholder's, or group of shareholders', nominees for director. We believe that these rules will benefit shareholders by improving corporate suffrage, the disclosure provided in connection with corporate proxy solicitations, and communication between shareholders in the proxy process. The new rules apply only where, among other things, relevant state or foreign law does not prohibit shareholders from nominating directors. The new rules will require that specified disclosures be made concerning nominating shareholders or groups and their nominees. In addition, the new rules provide that companies must include in their proxy materials, under certain circumstances, shareholder proposals that seek to establish a procedure in the company's governing documents for the inclusion of one or more shareholder director nominees in the company's proxy materials. We also are adopting related changes to certain of our other rules and regulations, including the existing solicitation exemptions from our proxy rules and the beneficial ownership reporting requirements.

Specifically, the proposals would require a registrant to provide, in a separately captioned subsection of Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, a comprehensive explanation of its short-term borrowings, including both quantitative and qualitative information. The proposed amendments would be applicable to annual and quarterly reports, proxy or information statements that include financial statements, registration statements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. We are also proposing conforming amendments to Form 8-K so that the Form would use the terminology contained in the proposed short-term borrowings disclosure requirement. In a companion release, we are providing interpretive guidance that is intended to improve overall discussion of liquidity and capital resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in order to facilitate understanding by investors of the liquidity and funding risks facing the registrant.

We are proposing new requirements in order to implement Section 945 and a portion of Section 932 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the ``Act''). First, we are proposing a new rule under the Securities Act of 1933 to require any issuer registering the offer and sale of an asset-backed security (``ABS'') to perform a review of the assets underlying the ABS. We also are proposing amendments to Item 1111 of Regulation AB that would require an ABS issuer to disclose the nature of its review of the assets and the findings and conclusions of the issuer's review of the assets. If the issuer has engaged a third party for purposes of reviewing the assets, we propose to require that the issuer disclose the third-party's findings and conclusions. We also are proposing to require that an issuer or underwriter of an ABS offering file a new form to include certain disclosure relating to third-party due diligence providers, to implement Section 15E(s)(4)(A) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a new provision added by Section 932 of the Act.

Reporting of Security-Based Swap Transaction Data
Section 766 of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') requires the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') to adopt an interim final rule for the reporting of security-based swaps entered into before July 21, 2010, the terms of which had not expired as of that date (``pre-enactment security-based swap transactions''), within 90 days of the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Pursuant to this requirement, the Commission today is adopting an interim final temporary rule that requires specified counterparties to pre-enactment security-based swap transactions to report certain information relating to pre-enactment security-based swaps to a registered security-based swap data repository or to the Commission by the compliance date established in the security-based swap reporting rules required under Sections 3C(e) and 13A(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''),\1\ or within 60 days after a registered security- based swap data repository commences operations to receive and maintain data concerning such security-based swaps, whichever occurs first and report information relating to pre-enactment security-based swaps to the Commission upon request. The Commission also is issuing an Interpretive Note to the rule that states that counterparties that may be required to report to the Commission will need to preserve information pertaining to the terms of these pre-enactment security- based swaps. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulation MC is designed to mitigate potential conflicts of interest that could exist at these entities. Specifically, the Commission seeks to mitigate the potential conflicts of interest through conditions and structures relating to ownership, voting, and governance of security- based swap clearing agencies, SB SEFs, and SBS exchanges.

We are proposing amendments to our rules to implement the provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to shareholder approval of executive compensation and ``golden parachute'' compensation arrangements. Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by adding Section 14A, which requires companies to conduct a separate shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of executives, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K or any successor to Item 402. Section 14A also requires companies to conduct a separate shareholder advisory vote to determine how often an issuer will conduct a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, Section 14A requires companies soliciting votes to approve merger or acquisition transactions to provide disclosure of certain ``golden parachute'' compensation arrangements and, in certain circumstances, to conduct a separate shareholder advisory vote to approve the golden parachute compensation arrangements.

Regulation SHO
The Commission is extending for a limited period of time the compliance date for the amendments to Rule 201 and Rule 200(g) of Regulation SHO under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). Rule 201 adopts a short sale-related circuit breaker that, if triggered, will impose a restriction on the prices at which securities may be sold short (``short sale price test restriction''). The amendments to Rule 200(g) provide that a broker-dealer may mark certain qualifying short sale orders ``short exempt.'' The Commission is extending the compliance date for the amendments to Rule 201 and Rule 200(g) to give certain exchanges additional time to modify their current procedures for conducting single-priced opening, reopening, and closing transactions for covered securities that have triggered Rule 201's circuit breaker in a manner that is consistent with the goals and requirements of Rule 201. Further, the extended compliance period will give industry participants additional time for programming and testing for compliance with the requirements of the Rule.

Risk Management Controls for Brokers or Dealers With Market Access
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is adopting new Rule 15c3-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). Rule 15c3-5 will require brokers or dealers with access to trading securities directly on an exchange or alternative trading system (``ATS''), including those providing sponsored or direct market access to customers or other persons, and broker-dealer operators of an ATS that provide access to trading securities directly on their ATS to a person other than a broker or dealer, to establish, document, and maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures that, among other things, are reasonably designed to systematically limit the financial exposure of the broker or dealer that could arise as a result of market access, and ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements that are applicable in connection with market access. The required financial risk management controls and supervisory procedures must be reasonably designed to prevent the entry of orders that exceed appropriate pre-set credit or capital thresholds, or that appear to be erroneous. The regulatory risk management controls and supervisory procedures must also be reasonably designed to prevent the entry of orders unless there has been compliance with all regulatory requirements that must be satisfied on a pre-order entry basis, prevent the entry of orders that the broker or dealer or customer is restricted from trading, restrict market access technology and systems to authorized persons, and assure appropriate surveillance personnel receive immediate post-trade execution reports. The financial and regulatory risk management controls and supervisory procedures required by Rule 15c3-5 must be under the direct and exclusive control of the broker or dealer with market access, with limited exceptions specified in the Rule that permit reasonable allocation of certain controls and procedures to another registered broker or dealer that, based on its position in the transaction and relationship with the ultimate customer, can more effectively implement them. In addition, a broker or dealer with market access will be required to establish, document, and maintain a system for regularly reviewing the effectiveness of the risk management controls and supervisory procedures and for promptly addressing any issues. Among other things, the broker or dealer will be required to review, no less frequently than annually, the business activity of the broker or dealer in connection with market access to assure the overall effectiveness of such risk management controls and supervisory procedures and document that review. The review will be required to be conducted in accordance with written procedures and will be required to be documented. In addition, the Chief Executive Officer (or equivalent officer) of the broker or dealer will be required, on an annual basis, to certify that the risk management controls and supervisory procedures comply with Rule 15c3-5, and that the regular review described above has been conducted.

Proposed Rules for Implementing the Whistleblower Provisions of Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
The Commission is proposing rules and forms to implement Section 21F of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') entitled ``Securities Whistleblower Incentives and Protection'' and seeking comment thereon. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on July 21, 2010 (``Dodd-Frank''), established a whistleblower program that requires the Commission to pay an award, under regulations prescribed by the Commission and subject to certain limitations, to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about a violation of the Federal securities laws that leads to the successful enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action, or a related action. Dodd-Frank also prohibits retaliation by employers against individuals that provide the Commission with information about potential securities violations.

In accordance with Section 763 (``Section 763'') and Section 766 (``Section 766'') of Title VII (``Title VII'') of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is proposing Regulation SBSR--Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information (``Regulation SBSR'') under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'').\1\ Proposed Regulation SBSR would provide for the reporting of security- based swap information to registered security-based swap data repositories or the Commission and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing information. Registered security-based swap data repositories would be required to establish and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and disseminated, and participants of registered security-based swap data repositories that are security- based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants would be required to establish and maintain policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable reporting obligations. Finally, proposed Regulation SBSR also would require a registered SDR to register with the Commission as a securities information processor on existing Form SIP. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

These rules and rule amendments are designed to give effect to provisions of Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Act that, among other things, increase the statutory threshold for registration by investment advisers with the Commission, require advisers to hedge funds and other private funds to register with the Commission, and require reporting by certain investment advisers that are exempt from registration. In addition, we are proposing rule amendments, including amendments to the Commission's pay-to-play rule, that address a number of other changes to the Advisers Act made by the Dodd-Frank Act.

As required by Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Act--the Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010, the new rules would define ``venture capital fund'' and provide for an exemption for advisers with less than $150 million in private fund assets under management in the United States. The new rules would also clarify the meaning of certain terms included in a new exemption for foreign private advisers.

The Commission also is proposing to specify that when a security-based swap is required to be cleared, the submission of the security-based swap for clearing must be for central clearing to a clearing agency that functions as a central counterparty. In addition, the Commission is proposing rules to define and describe when notices of proposed changes to rules, procedures or operations are required to be filed by designated financial market utilities in accordance with Section 806(e) of Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act and to set forth the process for filing such notices with the Commission. Furthermore, the Commission is proposing rules to make conforming changes as required by the amendments to Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act contained in Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the Commission) is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (EDGAR) Filer Manual to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The revisions are being made primarily to implement the new EDGARLink Online Application which will allow filers to submit EDGARLink submission form types online without the use of the offline EDGARLink Tool, to support the electronic filing of submission form types ABS 15G, ABS 15G/A, a new Form 8-K Item 6.10, and to support minor changes in XBRL validations for filings containing Exhibit 101 attachments. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded to support this functionality on December 13, 2010. The filer manual is also being revised to address changes previously made in EDGAR to support the electronic filing of new submission form types SC 14N, SC 14N/A, SC 14N-S, SC 14N-S/A, and the new Form 8-K Item 5.08. The revisions to the Filer Manual reflect changes within Volume I entitled EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume I: ``General Information,'' Version 9 (December 2010) and Volume II entitled EDGAR Filer Manual, Volume II: ``EDGAR Filing,'' Version 16 (December 2010).

Suspension of the Duty To File Reports for Classes of Asset-Backed Securities Under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

In addition, the Commission is amending its rules to delegate authority to the Chief Accountant to determine the appropriateness of extending the time periods specified in Section 19(b) and publish the reasons for such determination as well as to effect any such extension and to institute proceedings to determine whether to disapprove a proposal and to provide to the PCAOB notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration, and to find good cause to approve a proposal on an accelerated basis and to publish the reasons for such determination. This delegation is intended to conserve Commission resources and to maintain the effectiveness and efficiency of the Commission's PCAOB proposed rule filing process.

Trade Acknowledgment and Verification of Security-Based Swap Transactions
In accordance with Section 764(a) of Title VII of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (``Dodd- Frank Act''), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is proposing rule 15Fi-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., which would require security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants to provide trade acknowledgments and to verify those trade acknowledgments in security-based swap transactions.

Rules of Practice
Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') \1\ amended Section 19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''),\2\ which governs the handling of proposed rule changes submitted by self-regulatory organizations (``SROs''). Among other things, the Dodd-Frank Act's amendments to Section 19 of the Exchange Act require the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') to promulgate rules setting forth the procedural requirements of proceedings to determine whether a proposed rule change should be disapproved. In satisfaction of this requirement, the Commission is adopting new Rules of Practice to formalize the process it will use when conducting proceedings to determine whether an SRO's proposed rule change should be disapproved under Section 19(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. The new rules are intended to add transparency to the Commission's conduct of those proceedings and address the process the Commission will follow to institute proceedings and provide notice of the grounds for disapproval under consideration as well as provide interested parties with an opportunity to submit written materials to the Commission. In addition, the Commission is making conforming changes to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act in recognition of the new Rules of Practice. Further, pursuant to Section 107 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (``Sarbanes- Oxley Act''), the provisions of paragraphs (1) through (3) of Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act govern the proposed rules of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (``PCAOB'').\3\ The Commission is amending Regulation P to add a rule providing that these new Rules of Practice also formalize the process the Commission will use when conducting proceedings to determine whether a PCAOB proposed rule should be disapproved. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Net Worth Standard for Accredited Investors
We are proposing amendments to the accredited investor standards in our rules under the Securities Act of 1933 to reflect the requirements of Section 413(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Section 413(a) requires the definitions of ``accredited investor'' in our Securities Act rules to exclude the value of a person's primary residence for purposes of determining whether the person qualifies as an ``accredited investor'' on the basis of having a net worth in excess of $1 million. This change to the net worth standard was effective upon enactment by operation of the Dodd- Frank statute, but Section 413(a) also requires us to revise our current Securities Act rules to reflect the new standard. We also are proposing technical amendments to Form D and a number of our rules to conform them to the language of Section 413(a) and to correct cross- references to former Section 4(6) of the Securities Act, which was renumbered Section 4(5) by Section 944 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Section 951 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by adding Section 14A, which requires companies to conduct a separate shareholder advisory vote to approve the compensation of executives, as disclosed pursuant to Item 402 of Regulation S-K or any successor to Item 402. Section 14A also requires companies to conduct a separate shareholder advisory vote to determine how often an issuer will conduct a shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation. In addition, Section 14A requires companies soliciting votes to approve merger or acquisition transactions to provide disclosure of certain ``golden parachute'' compensation arrangements and, in certain circumstances, to conduct a separate shareholder advisory vote to approve the golden parachute compensation arrangements.

Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') (collectively, ``we'' or the ``Commissions'') are proposing new rules under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to implement provisions of Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The proposed SEC rule would require investment advisers registered with the SEC that advise one or more private funds to file Form PF with the SEC. The proposed CFTC rule would require commodity pool operators (``CPOs'') and commodity trading advisors (``CTAs'') registered with the CFTC to satisfy certain proposed CFTC filing requirements by filing Form PF with the SEC, but only if those CPOs and CTAs are also registered with the SEC as investment advisers and advise one or more private funds. The information contained in Form PF is designed, among other things, to assist the Financial Stability Oversight Council in its assessment of systemic risk in the U.S. financial system. These advisers would file these reports electronically, on a confidential basis.

Registration and Regulation of Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities

The Commission also is proposing an interpretation of the definition of ``security-based swap execution facility'' set forth in Section 3(a)(77) of the Exchange Act to provide guidance on the characteristics of those systems or platforms that would satisfy the statutory definition. In addition, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 3a-1 under the Exchange Act to exempt a registered SB SEF from the Exchange Act's definition of ``exchange'' and to add Rule 15a-12 under the Exchange Act to exempt, subject to certain conditions, a registered SB SEF from regulation as a broker pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act.

Rule 17Ad-17; Transfer Agents', Brokers', and Dealers' Obligation To Search for Lost Securityholders; Paying Agents' Obligation To Search for Missing Securityholders
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') by adding a subsection entitled, ``Due Diligence for the Delivery of Dividends, Interest, and Other Valuable Property Rights.'' The amendment directs the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') to revise Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-17, ``Transfer Agents' Obligation to Search for Lost Securityholders'' to: extend to brokers and dealers the requirement of Rule 17Ad-17 to search for lost securityholders; add to Rule 17Ad-17 a requirement that ``paying agents'' notify ``missing security holders'' in writing that the paying agent has sent the missing security holder a check that has not yet been negotiated; add to Rule 17Ad-17 an exclusion for paying agents from the notification requirements when the value of the not yet negotiated check is less than $25; and add to Rule 17Ad-17 a provision clarifying that the written notification requirements shall have no effect on State escheatment laws. The amendment also requires the Commission to ``adopt such rules, regulations, and orders necessary to implement this subsection no later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this subsection.'' The Commission is publishing for comment proposed amendments to Rule 17Ad-17 to implement the statutory requirements.

Section 10C requires the Commission to adopt rules directing the national securities exchanges (the ``exchanges'') and national securities associations to prohibit the listing of any equity security of an issuer that is not in compliance with Section 10C's compensation committee and compensation adviser requirements. In accordance with the statute, the proposed rule would direct the exchanges to establish listing standards that, among other things, require each member of a listed issuer's compensation committee to be a member of the board of directors and to be ``independent,'' as defined in the listing standards of the exchanges adopted in accordance with the proposed rule. In addition, Section 10C(c)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to adopt new disclosure rules concerning the use of compensation consultants and conflicts of interest.

Credit Risk Retention
The OCC, Board, FDIC, Commission, FHFA, and HUD (the Agencies) are proposing rules to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o- 11), as added by section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the Agencies by rule.

Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
This is one of several proposed rules that the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') will be considering relating to the use of credit ratings in Commission rules and forms. Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') requires the Commission to remove any references to credit ratings from its regulations and to substitute such standard of creditworthiness as the Commission determines to be appropriate. In this release, the Commission is proposing to amend certain rules and one form under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') applicable to broker-dealer financial responsibility, distributions of securities, and confirmations of transactions. The Commission also is requesting comment on potential standards of creditworthiness for purposes of Exchange Act Sections 3(a)(41) and 3(a)(53), which define the terms ``mortgage related security'' and ``small business related security,'' respectively, as the Commission considers how to implement Section 939(e) of the Dodd- Frank Act.

On April 29, 2011, the OCC, Board, FDIC, Commission, FHFA and HUD (collectively, the ``Agencies'') published in the Federal Register a joint notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Credit Risk NPR'' or ``proposed rule''). Due to the complexity of the rulemaking and to allow parties more time to consider the impact of the Credit Risk NPR on affected markets, the Agencies have determined that an extension of the comment period until August 1, 2011, is appropriate. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposed rules and prepare their comments.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, enacted on July 21, 2010 (``Dodd-Frank''), established a whistleblower program that requires the Commission to pay an award, under regulations prescribed by the Commission and subject to certain limitations, to eligible whistleblowers who voluntarily provide the Commission with original information about a violation of the Federal securities laws that leads to the successful enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action, or a related action. Dodd-Frank also prohibits retaliation by employers against individuals who provide the Commission with information about possible securities violations.

Beneficial Ownership Reporting Requirements and Security-Based Swaps
We are readopting without change the relevant portions of Rules 13d-3 and 16a-1.

After making the necessary determinations, we are readopting the relevant portions of Rules 13d-3 and 16a-1 to confirm that, following the July 16, 2011 statutory effective date of Section 13(o), persons who purchase or sell security-based swaps will remain within the scope of these rules to the same extent as they are now.

Broker-Dealer Reports
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') is proposing amendments to the broker-dealer financial reporting rule under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''). The first set of amendments would, among other things, update the existing requirements of Exchange Act Rule 17a-5, facilitate the ability of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (the ``PCAOB'') to implement oversight of independent public accountants of broker-dealers as required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), and eliminate potentially redundant requirements for certain broker-dealers affiliated with, or dually- registered as, investment advisers. The second set of amendments would require broker-dealers that either clear transactions or carry customer accounts to consent to allowing the Commission and designated examining authorities (``DEAs'') to have access to independent public accountants to discuss their findings with respect to annual audits of the broker- dealers and to review related audit documentation. The third set of amendments would enhance the ability of the Commission and examiners of a DEA to oversee broker-dealers' custody practices by requiring broker- dealers to file a new Form Custody.

Risk Management Controls for Brokers or Dealers With Market Access
The Commission is extending the compliance date for certain recently adopted requirements of Rule 15c3-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). Specifically, the Commission is extending the compliance date, until November 30, 2011, for all of the requirements of Rule 15c3-5 for fixed income securities, and the requirements of Rule 15c3-5(c)(1)(i) for all securities. The compliance date remains July 14, 2011 for all provisions of Rule 15c3-5 not subject to this limited extension. Among other things, Rule 15c3-5 requires broker-dealers with access to trading securities directly on an exchange or alternative trading system (``ATS''), including those providing sponsored or direct market access to customers or other persons, and broker-dealer operators of an ATS that provide access to trading securities directly on their ATS to a person other than a broker-dealer, to establish, document, and maintain a system of risk management controls and supervisory procedures that, among other things, is reasonably designed to systematically limit the financial exposure of the broker-dealer that could arise as a result of market access, and ensure compliance with all regulatory requirements that are applicable in connection with market access. The Commission is extending the compliance date for all of the requirements of Rule 15c3-5 for fixed income securities, and the requirements of Rule 15c3-5(c)(1)(i) for all securities to give broker- dealers with market access additional time to develop, test, and implement the relevant risk management controls and supervisory procedures required under the Rule.

Exemptions for Advisers to Venture Capital Funds, Private Fund Advisers With Less Than $150 Million in Assets Under Management, and Foreign Private Advisers
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') is adopting rules to implement new exemptions from the registration requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 for advisers to certain privately offered investment funds; these exemptions were enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''). As required by Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Act--the Private Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010--the new rules define ``venture capital fund'' and provide an exemption from registration for advisers with less than $150 million in private fund assets under management in the United States. The new rules also clarify the meaning of certain terms included in a new exemption from registration for ``foreign private advisers.''

The interim final rules will exempt offers and sales of these security-based swaps from all provisions of the Securities Act, other than the Section 17(a) anti-fraud provisions, as well as exempt these security-based swaps from Exchange Act registration requirements and from the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, provided certain conditions are met. The interim final rules will remain in effect until the compliance date for final rules that we may adopt further defining the terms ``security- based swap'' and ``eligible contract participant.''

Amendment to Rule Filing Requirements for Dually-Registered Clearing Agencies
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is adopting an interim final rule to amend Rule 19b-4 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''). The amendment expands the list of categories that qualify for summary effectiveness under Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act to include any matter effecting a change in an existing service of a clearing agency registered with the Commission (``Registered Clearing Agency'') that both primarily affects the futures clearing operations of the clearing agency with respect to futures that are not security futures and does not significantly affect any securities clearing operations of the clearing agency or any related rights or obligations of the clearing agency or persons using such service. The Commission also is making a corresponding technical modification to the General Instructions for Form 19b-4 under the Exchange Act. The amendments to Rule 19b-4 and Form 19b-4 are intended to streamline the rule filing process in areas involving certain activities concerning non-security products that may be subject to overlapping regulation as a result of, in part, certain provisions under Section 763(b) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (``Dodd-Frank Act'') that would deem some clearing agencies to be registered with the Commission as of July 16, 2011.

Large Trader Reporting
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting new Rule 13h-1 and Form 13H under Section 13(h) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to assist the Commission in both identifying, and obtaining trading information on, market participants that conduct a substantial amount of trading activity, as measured by volume or market value, in the U.S. securities markets. Rule 13h-1 will require a ``large trader,'' defined as a person whose transactions in NMS securities equal or exceed 2 million shares or $20 million during any calendar day, or 20 million shares or $200 million during any calendar month, to identify itself to the Commission and make certain disclosures to the Commission on Form 13H. Upon receipt of Form 13H, the Commission will assign to each large trader an identification number that will uniquely and uniformly identify the trader, which the large trader must then provide to its registered broker-dealers. Such registered broker-dealers will then be required to maintain records of two additional data elements in connection with transactions effected through accounts of such large traders (the large trader identification number, and the time transactions in the account are executed). In addition, the Commission is requiring that such broker-dealers report large trader transaction information to the Commission upon request through the Electronic Blue Sheets systems currently used by broker-dealers for reporting trade information. Finally, certain registered broker-dealers subject to the Rule will be required to perform limited monitoring of their customers' accounts for activity that may trigger the large trader identification requirements of Rule 13h-1. The large trader reporting requirements are designed to provide the Commission with a valuable source of useful data to support its investigative and enforcement activities, as well as facilitate the Commission's ability to assess the impact of large trader activity on the securities markets, to reconstruct trading activity following periods of unusual market volatility, and to analyze significant market events for regulatory purposes.

Suspension of the Duty To File Reports for Classes of Asset-Backed Securities Under Section 15(D) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
Section 942(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act eliminated the automatic suspension of the duty to file under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for asset-backed securities issuers and granted the Commission the authority to issue rules providing for the suspension or termination of such duty. We are adopting rules to provide certain thresholds for suspension of the reporting obligations for asset-backed securities issuers. We are also amending our rules relating to the Exchange Act reporting obligations of asset-backed securities issuers in light of these statutory changes.

Use of Derivatives by Investment Companies Under the Investment Company Act of 1940
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') and its staff are reviewing the use of derivatives by management investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the ``Investment Company Act'' or ``Act'') and companies that have elected to be treated as business development companies (``BDCs'') under the Act (collectively, ``funds''). To assist in this review, the Commission is issuing this concept release and request for comments on a wide range of issues relevant to the use of derivatives by funds, including the potential implications for fund leverage, diversification, exposure to certain securities-related issuers, portfolio concentration, valuation, and related matters. In addition to the specific issues highlighted for comment, the Commission invites members of the public to address any other matters that they believe are relevant to the use of derivatives by funds. The Commission intends to consider the comments to help determine whether regulatory initiatives or guidance are needed to improve the current regulatory regime for funds and, if so, the nature of any such initiatives or guidance.

Treatment of Asset-Backed Issuers Under the Investment Company Act
The Commission is considering proposing amendments to Rule 3a- 7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'' or ``Act''), the rule that provides certain asset-backed issuers with a conditional exclusion from the definition of investment company. Amendments to Rule 3a-7 that the Commission may consider could reflect market developments since 1992, when Rule 3a-7 was adopted, and recent developments affecting asset-backed issuers, including the passage of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') and the Commission's recent rulemakings regarding the asset-backed securities markets. The Commission is withdrawing its 2008 proposal to amend Rule 3a-7, which was published July 11, 2008.

Companies Engaged in the Business of Acquiring Mortgages and Mortgage-Related Instruments
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') and its staff (``Commission staff'' or ``staff'') are reviewing interpretive issues under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'' or ``Act'') relating to the status under the Act of companies that are engaged in the business of acquiring mortgages and mortgage-related instruments and that rely on the exclusion from the definition of investment company in Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Act (together, ``mortgage-related pools''). This review is focusing, among others, on certain real estate investment trusts (``REITs''). To help facilitate this review, the Commission requests information about these companies and how Section 3(c)(5)(C) of the Act is interpreted by, and affects investors in, these companies. The Commission solicits commenters' views about the application of the Investment Company Act to mortgage-related pools, including suggestions on the steps that the Commission should take to provide greater clarity, consistency or regulatory certainty with respect to Section 3(c)(5)(C).

Proposed Rule 127B under the Securities Act would prohibit certain persons who create and distribute an asset- backed security, including a synthetic asset-backed security, from engaging in transactions, within one year after the date of the first closing of the sale of the asset-backed security, that would involve or result in a material conflict of interest with respect to any investor in the asset-backed security. The proposed rule also would provide exceptions from this prohibition for certain risk-mitigating hedging activities, liquidity commitments, and bona fide market-making.

Reporting by Investment Advisers to Private Funds and Certain Commodity Pool Operators and Commodity Trading Advisors on Form PF
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') (collectively, ``we'' or the ``Commissions'') are adopting new rules under the Commodity Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to implement provisions of Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The new SEC rule requires investment advisers registered with the SEC that advise one or more private funds and have at least $150 million in private fund assets under management to file Form PF with the SEC. The new CFTC rule requires commodity pool operators (``CPOs'') and commodity trading advisors (``CTAs'') registered with the CFTC to satisfy certain CFTC filing requirements with respect to private funds, should the CFTC adopt such requirements, by filing Form PF with the SEC, but only if those CPOs and CTAs are also registered with the SEC as investment advisers and are required to file Form PF under the Advisers Act. The new CFTC rule also allows such CPOs and CTAs to satisfy certain CFTC filing requirements with respect to commodity pools that are not private funds, should the CFTC adopt such requirements, by filing Form PF with the SEC. Advisers must file Form PF electronically, on a confidential basis. The information contained in Form PF is designed, among other things, to assist the Financial Stability Oversight Council in its assessment of systemic risk in the U.S. financial system.

Section 1503(b) of the Act mandates the filing of a Form 8-K disclosing the receipt of certain orders and notices from the Mine Safety and Health Administration.

Net Worth Standard for Accredited Investors
We are adopting amendments to the accredited investor standards in our rules under the Securities Act of 1933 to implement the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Act requires the definitions of ``accredited investor'' in our Securities Act rules to exclude the value of a person's primary residence for purposes of determining whether the person qualifies as an ``accredited investor'' on the basis of having a net worth in excess of $1 million. This change to the net worth standard was effective upon enactment by operation of the Dodd-Frank Act, but it also requires us to revise our current Securities Act rules to conform to the new standard. We also are adopting technical amendments to Form D and a number of our rules to conform them to the requirements of the Act and to correct cross-references to former Section 4(6) of the Securities Act, which was renumbered Section 4(5) by Section 944 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Prohibitions and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Interests in, and Relationships With, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds
On November 7, 2011, the OCC, Board, FDIC, and SEC (collectively, the ``Agencies'') published in the Federal Register a joint notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment to implement section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') which contains certain prohibitions and restrictions on the ability of a banking entity and nonbank financial company supervised by the Board to engage in proprietary trading and have certain interests in, or relationships with, a hedge fund or private equity fund (``proposed rule''). Due to the complexity of the issues involved and to facilitate coordination of the rulemaking among the responsible agencies as provided in section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the Agencies have determined that an extension of the comment period until February 13, 2012 is appropriate. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposed rules and prepare their comments.

Investment Adviser Performance Compensation
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is adopting amendments to the rule under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that permits investment advisers to charge performance based compensation to ``qualified clients.'' The amendments revise the dollar amount thresholds of the rule's tests that are used to determine whether an individual or company is a qualified client. These rule amendments codify revisions that the Commission recently issued by order that adjust the dollar amount thresholds to account for the effects of inflation. In addition, the rule amendments: provide that the Commission will issue an order every five years in the future adjusting the dollar amount thresholds for inflation; exclude the value of a person's primary residence and certain associated debt from the test of whether a person has sufficient net worth to be considered a qualified client; and add certain transition provisions to the rule.

Identity Theft Red Flags Rules
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC,'' together with the CFTC, the ``Commissions'') are jointly issuing proposed rules and guidelines to implement new statutory provisions enacted by Title X of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. These provisions amend section 615(e) of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and direct the Commissions to prescribe rules requiring entities that are subject to the Commissions' jurisdiction to address identity theft in two ways. First, the proposed rules and guidelines would require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The Commissions also are proposing guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of a program that would satisfy the requirements of the proposed rules. Second, the proposed rules would establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the Commissions' jurisdiction, to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances.

The rule proposal would, if adopted, require a target date retirement fund that includes the target date in its name to disclose the fund's asset allocation at the target date immediately adjacent to the first use of the fund's name in marketing materials; require marketing materials for target date retirement funds to include a table, chart, or graph depicting the fund's asset allocation over time, together with a statement that would highlight the fund's final asset allocation; require a statement in marketing materials to the effect that a target date retirement fund should not be selected based solely on age or retirement date, is not a guaranteed investment, and the stated asset allocations may be subject to change; and provide additional guidance regarding statements in marketing materials for target date retirement funds and other investment companies that could be misleading.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is reopening the comment period for proposed amendments to its net capital, customer protection, books and records, and notification rules for broker-dealers under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act''), which was issued by the Commission on March 9, 2007. The original comment period for the proposed amendments closed on May 18, 2007, and the Commission extended the public comment period until June 18, 2007. The Commission did not act on the rules at that time. The Commission is presently reconsidering the proposed rule amendments. Given the passage of time since the amendments were proposed, the Commission is reopening for 30 days the time period in which to provide the Commission with comments.

Statement of General Policy on the Sequencing of the Compliance Dates for Final Rules Applicable to Security-Based Swaps Adopted Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
We are requesting public comment on a statement of general policy (``Statement'') on the anticipated sequencing of the compliance dates of final rules to be adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to certain provisions of Title VII of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended by those provisions (``Exchange Act''). These provisions establish a framework for the regulation of security-based swaps and security-based swap market participants under the Exchange Act. The Statement presents a sequencing of the compliance dates for these final rules by grouping the rules into five categories and describes the interconnectedness of the compliance dates for these rules, both within and among the five categories. The Statement also describes the timing of the expiration of the relief previously granted by the Commission that provided exemptions from certain provisions of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act of 1933, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

Listing Standards for Compensation Committees
We are adopting a new rule and amendments to our proxy disclosure rules to implement Section 952 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, which added Section 10C to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 10C requires the Commission to adopt rules directing the national securities exchanges and national securities associations to prohibit the listing of any equity security of an issuer that is not in compliance with Section 10C's compensation committee and compensation adviser requirements. In accordance with the statute, new Rule 10C-1 directs the national securities exchanges to establish listing standards that, among other things, require each member of a listed issuer's compensation committee to be a member of the board of directors and to be ``independent,'' as defined in the listing standards of the national securities exchanges adopted in accordance with the final rule. In addition, pursuant to Section 10C(c)(2), we are adopting amendments to our proxy disclosure rules concerning issuers' use of compensation consultants and related conflicts of interest.

Process for Submissions for Review of Security-Based Swaps for Mandatory Clearing and Notice Filing Requirements for Clearing Agencies; Technical Amendments to Rule 19b-4 and Form 19b-4 Applicable to All Self-Regulatory Organizations
In accordance with Section 763(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (``Dodd-Frank Act''), the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to specify the process for a registered clearing agency's submission for review of any security-based swap, or any group, category, type or class of security-based swaps, that the clearing agency plans to accept for clearing, the manner of notice the clearing agency must provide to its members of such submission and the procedure by which the Commission may stay the requirement that a security-based swap is subject to mandatory clearing while the clearing of the security-based swap is reviewed. The Commission also is adopting a rule to specify that when a security-based swap is required to be cleared, the submission of the security-based swap for clearing must be for central clearing to a clearing agency that functions as a central counterparty. In addition, the Commission is adopting rules to define and describe when notices of proposed changes to rules, procedures or operations are required to be filed by designated financial market utilities in accordance with Section 806(e) of Title VIII of the Dodd-Frank Act and to set forth the process for filing such notices with the Commission. Finally, the Commission is adopting rules to make conforming changes as required by the amendments to Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act contained in Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Act.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is making a technical amendment to rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to correct an inadvertent error. On December 21, 2011, the Commission extended the expiration date for the temporary municipal advisor registration regime to September 30, 2012. In the release extending the expiration date, the Commission inadvertently omitted a reference to Subpart N, which resulted in the deletion of Subpart N from the Code of Federal Regulations. With this technical amendment, the Commission is correcting the omission and adding back Subpart N to the Code of Federal Regulations.

Commission Guidance Regarding Definitions of Mortgage Related Security and Small Business Related Security
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') is publishing interpretive guidance with respect to sections 3(a)(41) (the definition of ``mortgage related security'') and 3(a)(53)(A) (the definition of ``small business related security'') of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), in light of section 939(e) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''). Section 939(e) strikes provisions in sections 3(a)(41) and 3(a)(53)(A) of the Exchange Act that reference credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (``NRSROs''), and inserts new text that provides that in order to satisfy these definitions a security must meet ``standards of credit-worthiness as established by the Commission.'' Because more time is needed to develop and establish standards of creditworthiness for purposes of these definitions, the Commission is providing a transitional interpretation that will be applicable on and after July 20, 2012, and until such time as final Commission rules establishing new standards of creditworthiness become effective. The Commission also is seeking comment on potential standards of creditworthiness that could be established to replace the use of NRSRO credit ratings in the definitions of the terms ``mortgage related security'' and ``small business related security.''

Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and Rule 144A Offerings
We are proposing amendments to Rule 506 of Regulation D and Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 to implement Section 201(a) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The proposed amendment to Rule 506 would provide that the prohibition against general solicitation and general advertising contained in Rule 502(c) of Regulation D would not apply to offers and sales of securities made pursuant to Rule 506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited investors. The proposed amendment to Rule 506 would also require that, in Rule 506 offerings that use general solicitation or general advertising, the issuer take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers of the securities are accredited investors. The proposed amendment to Rule 144A(d)(1) would provide that securities may be offered pursuant to Rule 144A to persons other than qualified institutional buyers, provided that the securities are sold only to persons that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe are qualified institutional buyers. We are also proposing to revise Form D to add a separate check box for issuers to indicate whether they are using general solicitation or general advertising in a Rule 506 offering.

Conflict Minerals
We are adopting a new form and rule pursuant to Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to the use of conflict minerals. Section 1502 added Section 13(p) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires the Commission to promulgate rules requiring issuers with conflict minerals that are necessary to the functionality or production of a product manufactured by such person to disclose annually whether any of those minerals originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country. If an issuer's conflict minerals originated in those countries, Section 13(p) requires the issuer to submit a report to the Commission that includes a description of the measures it took to exercise due diligence on the conflict minerals' source and chain of custody. The measures taken to exercise due diligence must include an independent private sector audit of the report that is conducted in accordance with standards established by the Comptroller General of the United States. Section 13(p) also requires the issuer submitting the report to identify the auditor and to certify the audit. In addition, Section 13(p) requires the report to include a description of the products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured that are not ``DRC conflict free,'' the facilities used to process the conflict minerals, the country of origin of the conflict minerals, and the efforts to determine the mine or location of origin. Section 13(p) requires the information disclosed by the issuer to be available to the public on its Internet Web site.

Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction Issuers
We are adopting new rules and an amendment to a new form pursuant to Section 1504 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act relating to disclosure of payments by resource extraction issuers. Section 1504 added Section 13(q) to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which requires the Commission to issue rules requiring resource extraction issuers to include in an annual report information relating to any payment made by the issuer, a subsidiary of the issuer, or an entity under the control of the issuer, to a foreign government or the Federal Government for the purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals. Section 13(q) requires a resource extraction issuer to provide information about the type and total amount of such payments made for each project related to the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals, and the type and total amount of payments made to each government. In addition, Section 13(q) requires a resource extraction issuer to provide information regarding those payments in an interactive data format.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting amendments to Rule 17Ad-17 to implement the requirements of Section 929W of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). That Section added to Section 17A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') subsection (g), ``Due Diligence for the Delivery of Dividends, Interest, and Other Valuable Property Rights,'' which directs the Commission to revise Exchange Act Rule 17Ad-17, ``Transfer Agents' Obligation to Search for Lost Securityholders'' to: extend the requirements of Rule 17Ad-17 to search for lost securityholders from only recordkeeping transfer agents to brokers and dealers as well; add a requirement that ``paying agents'' notify ``unresponsive payees'' that a paying agent has sent a securityholder a check that has not yet been negotiated; and add certain other provisions. The Commission also is adopting a proposed conforming amendment to Rule 17Ad-7(i) and new Rule 15b1-6, a technical rule to help ensure that brokers and dealers have notice of their new obligations with respect to lost securityholders and unresponsive payees.

Identity Theft Red Flags Rules
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (``CFTC'') and the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') (together, the ``Commissions'') are jointly issuing final rules and guidelines to require certain regulated entities to establish programs to address risks of identity theft. These rules and guidelines implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which amended the Fair Credit Reporting Act and directed the Commissions to adopt rules requiring entities that are subject to the Commissions' respective enforcement authorities to address identity theft. First, the rules require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program designed to detect, prevent, and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts. The rules include guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of programs that would satisfy the requirements of the rules. Second, the rules establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the Commissions' respective enforcement authorities, to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances.

Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities; Re-Proposal of Regulation SBSR and Certain Rules and Forms Relating to the Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is publishing for public comment proposed rules and interpretive guidance to address the application of the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (``Exchange Act''), that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''), to cross-border security-based swap activities. Our proposed rules and interpretive guidance address the application of Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to each of the major registration categories covered by Title VII relating to market intermediaries, participants, and infrastructures for security-based swaps, and certain transaction-related requirements under Title VII in connection with reporting and dissemination, clearing, and trade execution for security-based swaps. In this connection, we are re- proposing Regulation SBSR and certain rules and forms relating to the registration of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The proposal also contains a proposed rule providing an exception from the aggregation requirement, in the context of the security-based swap dealer definition, for affiliated groups with a registered security-based swap dealer. Moreover, the proposal addresses the sharing of information and preservation of confidentiality with respect to data collected and maintained by SDRs. In addition, the Commission is proposing rules and interpretive guidance addressing the policy and procedural framework under which the Commission would consider permitting compliance with comparable regulatory requirements in a foreign jurisdiction to substitute for compliance with requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, relating to security-based swaps (i.e., ``substituted compliance''). Finally, the Commission is setting forth our view of the scope of our authority, with respect to enforcement proceedings, under Section 929P of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Reopening of Comment Periods for Certain Proposed Rulemaking Releases and Policy Statements Applicable to Security-Based Swaps
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is reopening the comment periods for its outstanding rulemaking releases, published in the Federal Register and listed herein, that concern security-based swaps (``SB swaps'') and SB swap market participants and were proposed pursuant to certain provisions of Title VII of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act''), among other provisions (together, the ``Proposed Rules''). The Commission is also reopening the comment period for its Statement of General Policy on the Sequencing of the Compliance Dates for Final Rules Applicable to Security-Based Swaps adopted pursuant to the Exchange Act and the Dodd-Frank Act, published in the Federal Register on June 14, 2012 (the ``Policy Statement''). The reopening of these comment periods is intended to allow interested persons additional time to analyze and comment upon the Proposed Rules and the Policy Statement in light of the Commission's proposal of substantially all of the rules required to be adopted by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, its proposal of rules and interpretations addressing the application of the SB swap provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act to cross-border SB swap transactions and non-U.S. persons that act in capacities regulated under the Dodd- Frank Act (the ``Cross-Border Proposed Rules''), and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's (the ``CFTC'') adoption of substantially all of the rulemakings establishing the new regulatory framework for swaps. All comments received to date on the Proposed Rules and the Policy Statement will be considered and need not be resubmitted.

Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is proposing two alternatives for amending rules that govern money market mutual funds (or ``money market funds'') under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The two alternatives are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, the benefits of money market funds. The first alternative proposal would require money market funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios, rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a ``floating'' net asset value per share (``NAV''). The second alternative proposal would require money market funds to impose a liquidity fee (unless the fund's board determines that it is not in the best interest of the fund) if a fund's liquidity levels fell below a specified threshold and would permit the funds to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to ``gate'' the fund under the same circumstances. Under this proposal, we could adopt either alternative by itself or a combination of the two alternatives. The SEC also is proposing additional amendments that are designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and increasing transparency by requiring money market funds to provide additional information to the SEC and to investors. The proposal also includes amendments requiring investment advisers to certain unregistered liquidity funds, which can resemble money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC.

Rescission of Supervised Investment Bank Holding Company Rules
The Securities and Exchange Commission (the ``Commission'') is rescinding rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ``Exchange Act'') that established the Commission's program for supervising investment bank holding companies.

Eliminating the Prohibition Against General Solicitation and General Advertising in Rule 506 and Rule 144A Offerings
We are adopting amendments to Rule 506 of Regulation D and Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 to implement Section 201(a) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. The amendment to Rule 506 permits an issuer to engage in general solicitation or general advertising in offering and selling securities pursuant to Rule 506, provided that all purchasers of the securities are accredited investors and the issuer takes reasonable steps to verify that such purchasers are accredited investors. The amendment to Rule 506 also includes a non-exclusive list of methods that issuers may use to satisfy the verification requirement for purchasers who are natural persons. The amendment to Rule 144A provides that securities may be offered pursuant to Rule 144A to persons other than qualified institutional buyers, provided that the securities are sold only to persons that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the seller reasonably believe are qualified institutional buyers. We are also revising Form D to require issuers to indicate whether they are relying on the provision that permits general solicitation or general advertising in a Rule 506 offering. Also today, in a separate release, to implement Section 926 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, we are adopting amendments to Rule 506 to disqualify issuers and other market participants from relying on Rule 506 if ``felons and other `bad actors' '' are participating in the Rule 506 offering. We are also today, in a separate release, publishing for comment a number of proposed amendments to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156 under the Securities Act that are intended to enhance the Commission's ability to evaluate the development of market practices in Rule 506 offerings and address certain comments made in connection with implementing Section 201(a)(1) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act.

Amendments to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156
The Securities and Exchange Commission, which today in separate releases amended Rule 506 of Regulation D, Form D and Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933 to implement Section 201(a) of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act and Section 926 of the Dodd- Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, is publishing for comment a number of proposed amendments to Regulation D, Form D and Rule 156 under the Securities Act. These proposed amendments are intended to enhance the Commission's ability to evaluate the development of market practices in Rule 506 offerings and to address concerns that may arise in connection with permitting issuers to engage in general solicitation and general advertising under new paragraph (c) of Rule 506. Specifically, the proposed amendments to Regulation D would require the filing of a Form D in Rule 506(c) offerings before the issuer engages in general solicitation; require the filing of a closing amendment to Form D after the termination of any Rule 506 offering; require written general solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings to include certain legends and other disclosures; require the submission, on a temporary basis, of written general solicitation materials used in Rule 506(c) offerings to the Commission; and disqualify an issuer from relying on Rule 506 for one year for future offerings if the issuer, or any predecessor or affiliate of the issuer, did not comply, within the last five years, with Form D filing requirements in a Rule 506 offering. The proposed amendments to Form D would require an issuer to include additional information about offerings conducted in reliance on Regulation D. Finally, the proposed amendments to Rule 156 would extend the antifraud guidance contained in the rule to the sales literature of private funds.

The amendments further require a broker-dealer that clears transactions or carries customer accounts to agree to allow representatives of the Commission or the broker-dealer's designated examining authority (``DEA'') to review the documentation associated with certain reports of the broker-dealer's independent public accountant and to allow the accountant to discuss the findings relating to the reports of the accountant with those representatives when requested in connection with a regulatory examination of the broker- dealer. Finally, the amendments require a broker-dealer to file a new form with its DEA that elicits information about the broker-dealer's practices with respect to the custody of securities and funds of customers and non-customers.

Credit Risk Retention
The OCC, Board, FDIC, Commission, FHFA, and HUD (the agencies) are seeking comment on a joint proposed rule (the proposed rule, or the proposal) to revise the proposed rule the agencies published in the Federal Register on April 29, 2011, and to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15. U.S.C. 78o-11), as added by section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the agencies by rule.

Crowdfunding
The Securities and Exchange Commission is proposing for comment new Regulation Crowdfunding under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to implement the requirements of Title III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act. Regulation Crowdfunding would prescribe rules governing the offer and sale of securities under new Section 4(a)(6) of the Securities Act of 1933. The proposal also would provide a framework for the regulation of registered funding portals and brokers that issuers are required to use as intermediaries in the offer and sale of securities in reliance on Section 4(a)(6). In addition, the proposal would exempt securities sold pursuant to Section 4(a)(6) from the registration requirements of Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

The Commission is publishing the proposed rule change for public comment. Because SIPC rules have the force and effect as if promulgated by the Commission, those rules are published in Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

Registration of Municipal Advisors
Section 975 of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'') amended Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to require municipal advisors, as defined below, to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC''), effective October 1, 2010. To enable municipal advisors to temporarily satisfy this requirement, the Commission adopted an interim final temporary rule, Exchange Act Rule 15Ba2-6T, and form, Form MA-T, effective October 1, 2010. To enable municipal advisors to continue to register under the temporary registration regime until the applicable compliance date for permanent registration, the Commission is extending Rule 15Ba2-6T, in a separate release, to December 31, 2014. The Commission is today adopting new Rules 15Ba1-1 through 15Ba1-8, new Rule 15Bc4-1, and new Forms MA, MA-I, MA-W, and MA-NR under the Exchange Act. These rules and forms are designed to give effect to provisions of Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act that, among other things, require the Commission to establish a registration regime for municipal advisors and impose certain record-keeping requirements on such advisors.

To the extent possible, rulemaking actions by the Commission since that date have been reflected in the agenda. The Commission invites questions and public comment on the agenda and on the individual agenda entries. The Commission is now printing in the Federal Register, along with our preamble, only those agenda entries for which we have indicated that preparation of an RFA analysis is required.

Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings Under the Investment Company Act
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is adopting amendments to a rule and three forms under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'') and the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') in order to implement a provision of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). Specifically, rule 5b-3 under the Investment Company Act contains a reference to credit ratings in determining when an investment company (``fund'') may treat a repurchase agreement as an acquisition of securities collateralizing the repurchase agreement for certain purposes under the Investment Company Act. The amendments we are adopting today replace this reference to credit ratings with an alternative standard designed to retain a similar degree of credit quality to that in current rule 5b-3. The Commission is also adopting amendments to Forms N-1A, N-2, and N-3 under the Investment Company Act and Securities Act to eliminate the required use of NRSRO credit ratings when a fund chooses to depict its portfolio holdings by credit quality.

The effective date for the Rules and Forms was January 13, 2014. This stay of the Rules and Forms means that persons are not required to comply with the Rules and Forms until July 1, 2014. The Amendment is the only action the Commission is taking in this release with respect to the Rules and Forms. Therefore, the phased-in compliance period that begins on July 1, 2014, for the requirement to use the Forms to register as municipal advisors under the Rules remains unchanged.

Under the amendments, the expiration dates in the interim final rules will be extended to February 11, 2017. If we adopt further rules relating to issues raised by the application of the Securities Act or the other federal securities laws to security-based swaps before February 11, 2017, we may determine to alter the expiration dates in the interim final rules as part of that rulemaking.

Investment Company Advertising: Target Date Retirement Fund Names and Marketing
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is reopening the period for public comment on rule amendments it proposed in 2010, Investment Company Advertising: Target Date Retirement Fund Names and Marketing, Securities Act Release No. 9126 (June 16, 2010). Among other things, the proposed amendments would, if adopted, require marketing materials for target date retirement funds (``target date funds'') to include a table, chart, or graph depicting the fund's asset allocation over time, i.e., an illustration of the fund's so-called ``asset allocation glide path.'' In 2013, the Commission's Investor Advisory Committee (``Committee'') recommended that the Commission develop a glide path illustration for target date funds that is based on a standardized measure of fund risk as a replacement for, or supplement to, the proposed asset allocation glide path illustration. The Commission is reopening the comment period to seek public comment on this recommendation.

The Commission also is proposing an additional capital charge provision that would be added to the proposed capital rule for certain SBSDs. Finally, the Commission is proposing technical amendments to the broker-dealer recordkeeping, reporting, and notification requirements.

Money Market Fund Reform; Amendments to Form PF
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'' or ``SEC'') is adopting amendments to the rules that govern money market mutual funds (or ``money market funds'') under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'' or ``Act''). The amendments are designed to address money market funds' susceptibility to heavy redemptions in times of stress, improve their ability to manage and mitigate potential contagion from such redemptions, and increase the transparency of their risks, while preserving, as much as possible, their benefits. The SEC is removing the valuation exemption that permitted institutional non-government money market funds (whose investors historically have made the heaviest redemptions in times of stress) to maintain a stable net asset value per share (``NAV''), and is requiring those funds to sell and redeem shares based on the current market-based value of the securities in their underlying portfolios rounded to the fourth decimal place (e.g., $1.0000), i.e., transact at a ``floating'' NAV. The SEC also is adopting amendments that will give the boards of directors of money market funds new tools to stem heavy redemptions by giving them discretion to impose a liquidity fee if a fund's weekly liquidity level falls below the required regulatory threshold, and giving them discretion to suspend redemptions temporarily, i.e., to ``gate'' funds, under the same circumstances. These amendments will require all non-government money market funds to impose a liquidity fee if the fund's weekly liquidity level falls below a designated threshold, unless the fund's board determines that imposing such a fee is not in the best interests of the fund. In addition, the SEC is adopting amendments designed to make money market funds more resilient by increasing the diversification of their portfolios, enhancing their stress testing, and improving transparency by requiring money market funds to report additional information to the SEC and to investors. Finally, the amendments require investment advisers to certain large unregistered liquidity funds, which can have many of the same economic features as money market funds, to provide additional information about those funds to the SEC.

Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings and Amendment to the Issuer Diversification Requirement in the Money Market Fund Rule
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') is re-proposing certain amendments, initially proposed in March 2011, related to the removal of credit rating references in rule 2a-7, the principal rule that governs money market funds, and Form N-MFP, the form that money market funds use to report information to the Commission each month about their portfolio holdings, under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (``Investment Company Act'' or ``Act''). The re-proposed amendments would implement provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). We are issuing this re-proposal in consideration of comments received on our March 2011 proposal. In addition, we are proposing to amend rule 2a-7's issuer diversification provisions to eliminate an exclusion from these provisions that is currently available for securities subject to a guarantee issued by a non-controlled person.

Asset-Backed Securities Disclosure and Registration
We are adopting significant revisions to Regulation AB and other rules governing the offering process, disclosure, and reporting for asset-backed securities (``ABS''). The final rules require that, with some exceptions, prospectuses for public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and ongoing reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') of asset-backed securities backed by real estate related assets, auto related assets, or backed by debt securities, including resecuritizations, contain specified asset-level information about each of the assets in the pool. The asset-level information is required to be provided according to specified standards and in a tagged data format using eXtensible Markup Language (``XML''). We also are adopting rules to revise filing deadlines for ABS offerings to provide investors with more time to consider transaction-specific information, including information about the pool assets. We are also adopting new registration forms tailored to ABS offerings. The final rules also repeal the credit ratings references in shelf eligibility criteria for ABS issuers and establish new shelf eligibility criteria.

Delegation of Authority to the Chief Financial Officer
The Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') is amending its rules to delegate to the Chief Financial Officer the authority granted to the Commission by Section 21F(g)(4) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to request that the Secretary of the Treasury invest the portion of the Commission's whistleblower reward fund that, in its discretion, is not required to meet the current needs of the fund, and determine the maturities for those investments suitable to the needs of the fund. These changes are intended to streamline the operation of the Commission by delegating to staff certain routine financial responsibilities.
