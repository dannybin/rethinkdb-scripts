Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection With a Securitization or Participation After March 31, 2010
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') is issuing this Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit public comment regarding proposed amendments regarding the treatment by the FDIC, as receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution, of financial assets transferred by the institution in connection with a securitization or a participation after March 31, 2010 (the ``ANPR''). In November 2009, the FDIC issued an Interim Final Rule amending its regulation, Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection With a Securitization or Participation, to provide for safe harbor treatment for participations and securitizations until March 31, 2010 (the ``Interim Rule''). The ANPR requests comments on the standards that should be adopted to provide safe harbor treatment in connection with participations and securitizations issued after March 31, 2010. The ANPR seeks comment for forty-five (45) days on a range of issues that are implicated by proposed standards for a safe harbor for participations and securitizations issued after March 31, 2010. To provide a basis for consideration of the questions and the relationship of different conditions for such a safe harbor, the ANPR includes preliminary regulatory text that could be considered to set specific standards for such a safe harbor. This draft of regulatory text should be considered as one example of regulatory text, and not the only option to be considered. The Board's approval of the ANPR should not be considered as signifying adoption or recommendation of the preliminary regulatory text, but the text does provide context for response to the questions.

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines; Capital Adequacy Guidelines; Capital Maintenance: Regulatory Capital; Impact of Modifications to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles; Consolidation of Asset-Backed Commercial Paper Programs; and Other Related Issues
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the agencies) are amending their general risk- based and advanced risk-based capital adequacy frameworks by adopting a final rule that eliminates the exclusion of certain consolidated asset- backed commercial paper programs from risk-weighted assets; provides for an optional two-quarter implementation delay followed by an optional two-quarter partial implementation of the effect on risk- weighted assets that will result from changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; provides for an optional two-quarter delay, followed by an optional two-quarter phase-in, of the application of the agencies' regulatory limit on the inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses (ALLL) in tier 2 capital for the portion of the ALLL associated with the assets a banking organization consolidates as a result of changes to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles; and provides a reservation of authority to permit the agencies to require a banking organization to treat entities that are not consolidated under accounting standards as if they were consolidated for risk-based capital purposes, commensurate with the risk relationship of the banking organization to the structure. The delay and subsequent phase-in periods of the implementation will apply only to the agencies' risk-based capital requirements, not the leverage ratio requirement.

Transitional Safe Harbor Protection for Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection With a Securitization or Participation
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') is amending its regulation, Defining Transitional Safe Harbor Protection for Treatment By The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation As Conservator Or Receiver Of Financial Assets Transferred In Connection With A Securitization Or Participation. The amendment adds a new provision in order to continue for a limited time the safe harbor provision for securitizations that would be affected by recent changes to generally accepted accounting principles. In effect, the Final Rule permanently ``grandfathers'' all securitizations for which financial assets were transferred or, for revolving trusts, for which securities were issued prior to September 30, 2010 so long as those securitizations complied with the preexisting requirements under generally accepted accounting principles in effect prior to November 15, 2009. The transitional safe harbor will apply irrespective of whether or not the securitization satisfies all of the conditions for sale accounting treatment under generally accepted accounting principles as effective for reporting periods after November 15, 2009. In addition, the Final Rule confirms that section 360.6 will continue to protect participations.

Amendment of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program To Extend the Transaction Account Guarantee Program With Opportunity To Opt Out
The FDIC is issuing this Interim Rule to amend the Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) component of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) by providing an 6-month extension of the TAG program for insured depository institutions (IDIs) currently participating in the TAG program, with the possibility of an additional 12-month extension of the program without further rulemaking, upon a determination by the FDIC's Board of Directors (Board) that continuing economic difficulties warrant a continued extension. By virtue of this Interim Rule, the TAG program will be extended through December 31, 2010, with the possibility of an additional 12-month extension through December 31, 2011. In addition, while the Interim Rule presents no changes in the amount of the assessment for an IDI's continued participation in the TAG, it modifies the assessment basis for calculating the current risk- based assessments to one based on average daily balances in the TAG- related accounts. Further, the Interim Rule requires IDIs participating in the TAG program that offer NOW accounts covered by the program to reduce the interest rate on such accounts to a rate no higher than 0.25 percent and to commit to maintain that rate for the duration of the TAG extension in order for those NOW accounts to remain eligible for the FDIC's continued guarantee.

Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection With a Securitization or Participation After September 30, 2010
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') proposes to adopt amendments to the rule regarding the treatment by the FDIC, as receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution, of financial assets transferred by the institution in connection with a securitization or a participation after September 30, 2010 (the ``Proposed Rule''). The Proposed Rule would continue the safe harbor for transferred financial assets in connection with securitizations in which the financial assets were transferred under the existing regulations. The Proposed Rule would clarify the conditions for a safe harbor for securitizations or participations issued after September 30, 2010. The Proposed Rule also sets forth safe harbor protections for securitizations that do not comply with the new accounting standards for off balance sheet treatment by providing for expedited access to the financial assets that are securitized if they meet the conditions defined in the Proposed Rule. The conditions contained in the Proposed Rule would serve to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') and the FDIC's interests as deposit insurer and receiver by aligning the conditions for the safe harbor with better and more sustainable securitization practices by insured depository institutions (``IDIs''). The FDIC seeks comment on the regulations, the scope of the safe harbors provided, and the terms and scope of the conditions included in the Proposed Rule.

The IDI's plan would include a gap analysis that would identify impediments to the orderly stand-alone resolution of the IDI, and identify reasonable steps that are or will be taken to eliminate or mitigate such impediments. The contingent resolution plan, gap analysis, and mitigation efforts are intended to enable the FDIC to develop a reasonable strategy, plan or options for the orderly resolution of the institution. The proposal would apply only to IDIs with greater than $10 billion in total assets that are owned or controlled by parent companies with more than $100 billion in total assets.

Community Reinvestment Act Regulations
The OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the OTS (collectively, ``the agencies'') are issuing this proposed rule to revise provisions of our rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The agencies propose to revise the term ``community development'' to include loans, investments, and services by financial institutions that support, enable, or facilitate projects or activities that meet the criteria described in Section 2301(c)(3) of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA) and are conducted in designated target areas identified in plans approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program, established pursuant to the HERA and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The proposed rule would provide favorable CRA consideration to such activities that, pursuant to the requirements of the program, benefit low-, moderate-, and middle-income individuals and geographies in designated target areas. Such consideration would include covered activities within an institution's assessment area(s) and outside of its assessment area(s), as long as the institution has adequately addressed the community development needs of its assessment area(s). As proposed, favorable consideration under the new rule would only be available until no later than two years after the last date appropriated funds for the program are required to be spent by the grantees. The agencies will provide reasonable advance notice to institutions in the Federal Register regarding termination of the rule once a date certain has been identified.

Final Rule Regarding Amendment of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program To Extend the Transaction Account Guarantee Program
The FDIC is issuing a Final Rule extending the Transaction Account Guarantee (TAG) component of the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program (TLGP) through December 31, 2010, for insured depository institutions (IDIs) currently participating in the TAG program, with the possibility of an additional extension of up to 12 months without additional rulemaking, upon a determination by the FDIC's Board of Directors (Board) that continuing economic difficulties warrant further extension. The Final Rule differs only slightly from the interim rule that preceded it. The interim rule provided for the possibility of a further extension of the TAG program until December 31, 2011, without additional rulemaking, should the FDIC's Board determine that economic conditions warrant a further extension of the program. The Final Rule provides that, under appropriate economic conditions, the Board may further extend the TAG program for a period of time not to exceed December 31, 2011. Like the interim rule, the Final Rule modifies the assessment basis for calculating the assessment rate for an IDI's continued participation in the TAG to the average daily balances in the TAG-related accounts, but makes no changes to the assessment rate itself. Further, as in the interim rule the Final Rule requires IDIs that are participating in the TAG program and that offer NOW accounts covered by the program to reduce the interest rate on such accounts to a rate no higher than 0.25 percent and to commit to maintain that rate for the duration of the TAG extension in order for those NOW accounts to remain eligible for the FDIC's continued guarantee.

Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking Regarding Alternatives to the Use of Credit Ratings in the Risk-Based Capital Guidelines of the Federal Banking Agencies
The regulations of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) (collectively, the agencies) include various references to and requirements based on the use of credit ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), enacted on July 21, 2010, requires the agencies to review their regulations that require the use of an assessment of creditworthiness of a security or money market instrument and make reference to, or have requirements regarding, credit ratings. The agencies must then modify their regulations to remove any reference to, or requirements of reliance on, credit ratings in such regulations and substitute in their place other standards of creditworthiness that the agencies determine to be appropriate for such regulations. This advanced notice of proposed rulemaking (ANPR) describes the areas in the agencies' risk-based capital standards and Basel changes that could affect those standards that make reference to credit ratings and requests comment on potential alternatives to the use of credit ratings.

Deposit Insurance Regulations; Unlimited Coverage for Noninterest-bearing Transaction Accounts
The FDIC is proposing to amend its regulations to implement section 343 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''),\1\ providing for unlimited deposit insurance for ``noninterest-bearing transaction accounts'' for two years starting December 31, 2010. This unlimited coverage for ``noninterest-bearing transaction accounts'' is similar but not identical to the protection provided for such account owners under the FDIC's Transaction Account Guarantee Program (``TAGP''). The proposed rule serves as a vehicle for the FDIC Board of Directors to announce that it will not extend the TAGP beyond the scheduled expiration date of December 31, 2010. Because of the differences between the TAGP and the new statutory provision, changes to the rules are necessary. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Treatment by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation as Conservator or Receiver of Financial Assets Transferred by an Insured Depository Institution in Connection With a Securitization or Participation After September 30, 2010
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') has adopted an amended regulation regarding the treatment by the FDIC, as receiver or conservator of an insured depository institution, of financial assets transferred by the institution in connection with a securitization or a participation (the ``Rule''). The Rule continues the safe harbor for financial assets transferred in connection with securitizations and participations in which the financial assets were transferred in compliance with the existing regulation. The Rule also imposes further conditions for a safe harbor for securitizations or participations issued after a transition period. On March 11, 2010, the FDIC established a transition period through September 30, 2010. In order to provide for a transition to the new conditions for the safe harbor, the Rule provides for an extended transition period through December 31, 2010 for securitizations and participations. The Rule defines the conditions for safe harbor protection for securitizations and participations for which transfers of financial assets are made after the transition period; and clarifies the application of the safe harbor to transactions that comply with the new accounting standards for off balance sheet treatment as well as those that do not comply with those accounting standards. The conditions contained in the Rule will serve to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') and the FDIC's interests as deposit insurer and receiver by aligning the conditions for the safe harbor with better and more sustainable securitization practices by insured depository institutions (``IDIs'').

Securities of Nonmember Insured Banks
The FDIC is revising its securities disclosure regulations applicable to state nonmember banks with securities required to be registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The final rule cross references changes in regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) into the provisions of the FDIC's securities regulations. Cross referencing will assure that the FDIC's regulations remain substantially similar to the SEC's regulations, as required by law. The final rule provides general references to SEC regulations by title and part of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), rather than by specific references to sections and subparts of the CFR as are currently provided in part 335. This revision reflects changes to SEC regulations with respect to small business issuers and will provide general guidance to FDIC filers regarding the electronic filing of certain documents. The amendments to part 335 references to SEC regulations will greatly reduce the need for future revisions of part 335, and the FDIC's regulations will be consistent with the SEC regulations through the cross reference stated in 12 CFR 335.101.

Community Reinvestment Act Regulations
The OCC, the Board, the FDIC, and the OTS (collectively, ``the agencies'') are adopting revisions to our rules implementing the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). The agencies are revising the term ``community development'' to include loans, investments, and services by financial institutions that support, enable, or facilitate projects or activities that meet the ``eligible uses'' criteria described in Section 2301(c) of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 (HERA), as amended, and are conducted in designated target areas identified in plans approved by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP). The final rule provides favorable CRA consideration of such activities that, pursuant to the requirements of the program, benefit low-, moderate-, and middle-income individuals and geographies in NSP target areas designated as ``areas of greatest need.'' Covered activities are considered both within an institution's assessment area(s) and outside of its assessment area(s), as long as the institution has adequately addressed the community development needs of its assessment area(s). Favorable consideration under the revised rule will be available until no later than two years after the last date appropriated funds for the program are required to be spent by the grantees. The agencies will provide reasonable advance notice to institutions in the Federal Register regarding termination of the rule once a date certain has been identified.

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are requesting comment on a proposal to revise their market risk capital rules to modify their scope to better capture positions for which the market risk capital rules are appropriate; reduce procyclicality in market risk capital requirements; enhance the rules' sensitivity to risks that are not adequately captured under the current regulatory measurement methodologies; and increase transparency through enhanced disclosures. The proposal does not include the methodologies adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision for calculating the specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions due to their reliance on credit ratings, which is impermissible under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The proposal, therefore, retains the current specific risk treatment for these positions until the agencies develop alternative standards of creditworthiness as required by the Act. The proposed rules are substantively the same across the agencies.

Amendments to Deposit Insurance Regulations: Deposit Insurance Coverage Training; SMDIA Notification
The FDIC is proposing a rule that would promote public confidence in Federal deposit insurance by providing depositors with improved access to accurate information about FDIC insurance coverage of their accounts at insured depository institutions (IDIs). The proposed rule would accomplish this goal in three ways. First, it would require certain IDI personnel to complete FDIC-provided training on the fundamentals of FDIC deposit insurance coverage. These IDI personnel would include any employee with authority to open deposit accounts and/ or respond to customer questions about FDIC insurance coverage (hereafter ``employees''). Second, the proposed rule would require IDIs to implement procedures so that employees, when opening a new deposit account, inquire whether the customer has an ownership interest in any other account at the IDI and, if so, whether the customer's aggregate ownership interest in deposit accounts, including the new account, exceeds the Standard Maximum Deposit Insurance Amount (``SMDIA''). If this is the case, then the IDI employee would be required to provide the customer with a copy of the FDIC's publication, Deposit Insurance Summary. The proposed rule would apply to deposit accounts opened in person at the IDI, by telephone, mail, and via the Internet or other technology. Third, the rule would require IDIs to provide a link to the FDIC's Electronic Deposit Insurance Estimator (``EDIE'') on any Web site the IDI maintains for use by deposit customers.

Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than five percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the Agencies by rule.

The FDIC received no comments in response to the Interim Final Rule concerning these revisions. Accordingly, the Final Rule makes no changes from the Interim Final Rule that preceded it. The Final Rule incorporates, through cross references, changes in regulations adopted by the SEC into the provisions of the FDIC's securities regulations. Cross referencing will ensure that the FDIC's regulations remain substantially similar to the SEC's regulations, as required by law.

Retail Foreign Exchange Transactions
The FDIC is proposing regulations that would impose requirements for foreign currency futures, options on futures, and options that an insured depository institution supervised by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation engages in with retail customers. Pursuant to section 742(c) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, such transactions will be prohibited as of July 16, 2011, in the absence of the proposed requirements. The proposed regulations would also impose requirements on other foreign currency transactions that are functionally or economically similar to futures, options on futures, or options. These similar transactions include so-called ``rolling spot'' transactions that an individual enters into with a foreign currency dealer, usually through the Internet or other electronic platform, to transact in foreign currency. The regulations would not apply to traditional foreign currency forwards or spot transactions that a depository institution engages in with business customers to hedge foreign exchange risk.

Credit Risk Retention
On April 29, 2011, the OCC, Board, FDIC, Commission, FHFA and HUD (collectively, the ``Agencies'') published in the Federal Register a joint notice of proposed rulemaking for public comment to implement the credit risk retention requirements of section 15G of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as added by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Credit Risk NPR'' or ``proposed rule''). Due to the complexity of the rulemaking and to allow parties more time to consider the impact of the Credit Risk NPR on affected markets, the Agencies have determined that an extension of the comment period until August 1, 2011, is appropriate. This action will allow interested persons additional time to analyze the proposed rules and prepare their comments.

Disclosure of Information; Privacy Act Regulations; Notice and Amendments
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Act), abolished the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) and redistributed, as of July 21, 2011, the statutorily prescribed transfer date (Transfer Date), the functions and regulations of the OTS relating to savings and loan holding companies, Federal savings associations, and State savings associations to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the FDIC, respectively. The Board of Directors has determined that, effective on the Transfer Date, the OTS Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and Privacy Act (PA) regulations will not be enforced by the FDIC and that, instead, all FOIA and PA issues will be addressed under the FDIC's regulations involving disclosure of information and the PA, as amended. In taking this action the FDIC's goal is to avoid potential confusion and uncertainty that may arise regarding information concerning State savings associations after the Transfer Date.

Margin and Capital Requirements For Covered Swap Entities

Transfer and Redesignation of Certain Regulations Involving State Savings Associations Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank Act or the Act) provided that the functions, powers, and duties of the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) relating to State savings associations will transfer to the FDIC effective one year after July 21, 2010, the date that the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted. The Act also amended section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act) to designate the FDIC as the ``appropriate Federal banking agency'' for State savings associations. The FDIC is authorized to issue regulations pursuant to the FDI Act and other existing laws as the ``appropriate Federal banking agency'' (or under similar statutory terminology). As a result, pursuant to those laws, the FDIC, the newly-designated ``appropriate Federal banking agency'' for State savings associations, is authorized to issue certain regulations involving State savings associations. Consistent with the authority provided to the FDIC by the Dodd- Frank Act, the FDI Act, and other statutory authorities, the FDIC is reissuing and redesigning certain transferring OTS regulations. In republishing these rules, the FDIC is making only technical changes to existing OTS regulations (such as nomenclature or address changes). The FDIC is not republishing those OTS regulations for which other appropriate Federal banking agencies are authorized to act. In the future, the FDIC may take other actions related to the transferred rules: Incorporating them into other FDIC regulations contained in Title 12, Chapter III, amending them, or rescinding them, as appropriate.

Resolution Plans Required for Insured Depository Institutions With $50 Billion or More in Total Assets
The FDIC is adopting an interim final rule (``Rule''), with request for comments, requiring an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the FDIC a contingent plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure (``Resolution Plan''). The Rule establishes the requirements for submission and content of a Resolution Plan, as well as procedures for review by the FDIC. The Rule requires a covered insured depository institution (``CIDI'') to submit a Resolution Plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDI Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1821 and 1823, in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution's creditors. The FDIC finds that there is good cause and it is in the public interest to adopt the Rule. Resolution plans for large and complex insured depository institutions are essential for their orderly and least-cost resolution. The Rule is intended to address the continuing exposure of the banking industry to the risks of insolvency of large and complex insured depository institutions, an exposure that can be mitigated with proper resolution planning. The Rule enables the FDIC to perform its resolution functions most efficiently through extensive planning in cooperation with the CIDI and to enhance its ability to evaluate potential loss severity if an institution fails.

Permissible Investments for Federal and State Savings Associations: Corporate Debt Securities
The FDIC is seeking public comment to amend the FDIC's regulations in accordance with the requirements of Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDI Act). Specifically, to prohibit any insured savings association from acquiring and retaining a corporate debt security unless it determines, prior to acquiring such security and periodically thereafter, that the issuer has adequate capacity to meet all financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment. For purposes of the Proposed Rule, an issuer would satisfy this requirement if, based on the assessment of the savings association, the issuer presents a low risk of default and is likely to make full and timely repayment of principal and interest. As proposed, this standard is consistent with alternative creditworthiness standards proposed by other Federal agencies under the Dodd-Frank Act and existing guidance regarding securities investments and credit classifications of banks and savings associations. In connection with this NPR, the FDIC is also seeking public comment on proposed guidance, published elsewhere in today's Federal Register, that sets forth supervisory expectations for savings associations conducting due diligence to determine whether a corporate debt security is eligible for investment under this proposed rule.

Risk-Based Capital Guidelines: Market Risk; Alternatives to Credit Ratings for Debt and Securitization Positions
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on an amendment to the notice of proposed rulemaking (NPR) to modify the agencies' market risk capital rules, published in the Federal Register on January 11, 2011 (January 2011 NPR). The January 2011 NPR did not include the methodologies adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) for calculating the standard specific risk capital requirements for certain debt and securitization positions, because the BCBS methodologies generally rely on credit ratings. Under section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act), all federal agencies must remove references to and requirements of reliance on credit ratings from their regulations and replace them with appropriate alternatives for evaluating creditworthiness. In this NPR, the agencies are proposing to incorporate into the proposed market risk capital rules certain alternative methodologies for calculating specific risk capital requirements for debt and securitization positions that do not rely on credit ratings. The agencies expect to finalize this proposal, together with the January 2011 NPR, in the coming months after receipt and consideration of comments.

The FDIC is adopting this final rule (``Rule'') requiring an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the FDIC a contingent plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure (``Resolution Plan''). The Rule establishes the requirements for submission and content of a Resolution Plan, as well as procedures for review by the FDIC. The Rule requires a covered insured depository institution (``CIDI'') to submit a Resolution Plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDI Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1821 and 1823, in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss to be realized by the institution's creditors. The Rule is intended to address the continuing exposure of the banking industry to the risks of insolvency of large and complex insured depository institutions, an exposure that can be mitigated with proper resolution planning. The Interim Final Rule, which preceded this Rule, was effective January 1, 2012,\1\ and remains in effect until superseded by this Rule on April 1, 2012. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Enforcement of Subsidiary and Affiliate Contracts by the FDIC as Receiver of a Covered Financial Company
The FDIC is proposing a rule (``Proposed Rule''), with request for comments, that implements section 210(c)(16) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'' or the ``Act''), codified at 12 U.S.C. section 5390(c)(16), which permits the Corporation, as receiver for a financial company whose failure would pose a significant risk to the financial stability of the United States (a ``covered financial company''), to enforce contracts of subsidiaries or affiliates of the covered financial company despite contract clauses that purport to terminate, accelerate, or provide for other remedies based on the insolvency, financial condition or receivership of the covered financial company. As a condition to maintaining these subsidiary contracts in full force and effect, the Corporation as receiver must either: transfer any supporting obligations of the covered financial company that back the obligations of the subsidiary or affiliate under the contract (along with all assets and liabilities that relate to those supporting obligations) to a bridge financial company or qualified third-party transferee by the statutory one-business-day deadline; or provide adequate protection to such contract counterparties. The Proposed Rule sets forth the scope and effect of the authority granted under section 210(c)(16), clarifies the conditions and requirements applicable to the receiver, addresses requirements for notice to certain affected counterparties, and defines key terms.

Definition of “Predominantly Engaged in Activities That Are Financial in Nature or Incidental Thereto”
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') is amending the definition of ``financial activities'' set forth in section 380.8 of the FDIC's notice of proposed rulemaking published in the Federal Register on March 23, 2011 titled ``Orderly Liquidation Authority'' (``March 2011 NPR'').\1\ The March 2011 NPR proposed standards for determining if a company is predominantly engaged in financial activities for purposes of Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act'' or ``Act'').\2\ A company that is predominantly engaged in such activities is a ``financial company'' for purposes of Title II of the Act (unless it is one of the few entities specifically excepted). Provisions of the March 2011 NPR other than section 380.8 already have been finalized. Based on a number of factors described within this notice of proposed rulemaking (``NPR''), the FDIC believes that it is necessary to clarify the scope of the activities that would be considered to be financial activities. Accordingly, this NPR amends section 380.8 of the March 2011 NPR to clarify the activities that would be considered to be financial activities for purposes of determining if a company is predominantly engaged in such activities under Title II of the Act. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permissible Investments for Federal and State Savings Associations: Corporate Debt Securities
This final rule amends FDIC regulations to prohibit any insured savings association from acquiring or retaining a corporate debt security unless it determines, prior to acquiring such security and periodically thereafter, that the issuer has adequate capacity to meet all financial commitments under the security for the projected life of the investment. An issuer would satisfy this requirement if, based on the assessment of the savings association, the issuer presents a low risk of default and is likely to make full and timely repayment of principal and interest. This final rule adopts the proposed creditworthiness standard with the clarifying revision described below. In the final rule, the phrase ``projected life of the investment'' has been revised to ``projected life of the security'' to more closely track the language in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's (``OCC'') final rule.\1\ The clarifying revision addresses ambiguities in the proposed rule and harmonizes the final rule with the final rule adopted by the OCC regarding permissible investments for national banks.\2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Regulatory Capital Rules: Standardized Approach for Risk-Weighted Assets; Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on three notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) that would revise and replace the agencies' current capital rules. This NPR (Standardized Approach NPR) includes proposed changes to the agencies' general risk-based capital requirements for determining risk-weighted assets (that is, the calculation of the denominator of a banking organization's risk-based capital ratios). The proposed changes would revise and harmonize the agencies' rules for calculating risk- weighted assets to enhance risk-sensitivity and address weaknesses identified over recent years, including by incorporating certain international capital standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) set forth in the standardized approach of the ``International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework'' (Basel II), as revised by the BCBS between 2006 and 2009, and other proposals addressed in recent consultative papers of the BCBS. In this NPR, the agencies also propose alternatives to credit ratings for calculating risk-weighted assets for certain assets, consistent with section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). The revisions include methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets for residential mortgages, securitization exposures, and counterparty credit risk. The changes in the Standardized Approach NPR are proposed to take effect on January 1, 2015, with an option for early adoption. The Standardized Approach NPR also would introduce disclosure requirements that would apply to top-tier banking organizations domiciled in the United States with $50 billion or more in total assets, including disclosures related to regulatory capital instruments. In connection with the proposed changes to the agencies' capital rules in this NPR, the agencies are also seeking comment on the two related NPRs published elsewhere in today's Federal Register. The two related NPR's are discussed further in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Minimum Regulatory Capital Ratios, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, and Prompt Corrective Action
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on three Notices of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) that would revise and replace the agencies' current capital rules. In this NPR, the agencies are proposing to revise their risk-based and leverage capital requirements consistent with agreements reached by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) in ``Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems'' (Basel III). The proposed revisions would include implementation of a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement, a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, and, for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches capital rules, a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set of exposures in the denominator measure. Additionally, consistent with Basel III, the agencies are proposing to apply limits on a banking organization's capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the banking organization does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk- based capital requirements. This NPR also would establish more conservative standards for including an instrument in regulatory capital. As discussed in the proposal, the revisions set forth in this NPR are consistent with section 171 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), which requires the agencies to establish minimum risk-based and leverage capital requirements. In connection with the proposed changes to the agencies' capital rules in this NPR, the agencies are also seeking comment on the two related NPRs published elsewhere in today's Federal Register. The two related NPRs are discussed further in the SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule; Market Risk Capital Rule
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on three notices of proposed rulemaking (NPRs) that would revise and replace the agencies' current capital rules. In this NPR (Advanced Approaches and Market Risk NPR) the agencies are proposing to revise the advanced approaches risk-based capital rule to incorporate certain aspects of ``Basel III: A Global Regulatory Framework for More Resilient Banks and Banking Systems'' (Basel III) that the agencies would apply only to advanced approach banking organizations. This NPR also proposes other changes to the advanced approaches rule that the agencies believe are consistent with changes by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to its ``International Convergence of Capital Measurement and Capital Standards: A Revised Framework'' (Basel II), as revised by the BCBS between 2006 and 2009, and recent consultative papers published by the BCBS. The agencies also propose to revise the advanced approaches risk- based capital rule to be consistent with Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). These revisions include replacing references to credit ratings with alternative standards of creditworthiness consistent with section 939A of the Dodd- Frank Act. Additionally, the OCC and FDIC are proposing that the market risk capital rule be applicable to federal and state savings associations, and the Board is proposing that the advanced approaches and market risk capital rules apply to top-tier savings and loan holding companies domiciled in the United States that meet the applicable thresholds. In addition, this NPR would codify the market risk rule consistent with the proposed codification of the other regulatory capital rules across the three proposals.

Annual Stress Test
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the ``Corporation'' or ``FDIC'') is issuing a final rule that implements the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') regarding stress tests (``final rule''). The Dodd- Frank Act requires the Corporation to issue regulations that require FDIC-insured state nonmember banks and FDIC-insured state-chartered savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion to conduct annual stress tests, report the results of such stress tests to the Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board''), and publish a summary of the results of the stress tests. The final rule requires large covered banks to conduct annual stress tests beginning on the effective date of this final rule. The Corporation, however, will delay implementation of the annual stress test requirements under the final rule for institutions with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion until September 30, 2013. The final rule requirement for public disclosure of a summary of the stress testing results for these institutions will be implemented starting with the 2014 stress test, with the disclosure occurring during the period starting June 15 and ending June 30 of 2015.

Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) directs all federal agencies to publish an initial regulatory flexibility analysis (IRFA), or a summary thereof, describing the impact of a proposed rule on small entities anytime an agency is required to publish a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register.

The Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 1990, as amended, requires all Federal agencies that have statutory authority to impose civil money penalties (CMPs), every four years, to publish, as adjusted for inflation, the maximum authorized amount of those CMPs. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) last adjusted the maximum amounts of CMPs under its jurisdiction in 2008. The FDIC is issuing this final rule to publish the adjusted maximum CMPs.

Deposit Insurance Regulations; Definition of Insured Deposit
The FDIC is proposing to amend its deposit insurance regulations, with respect to deposits payable in branches of United States insured depository institutions (``United States bank'' or ``bank'') outside of the United States. The proposed rule would clarify that deposits in these foreign branches of United States banks are not FDIC-insured deposits. This would be the case whether or not they are dually payable both at the branch outside the United States and at an office within the United States. As discussed further below, a recent proposal by the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority (``U.K. FSA'') makes it very likely that large United States banks will be changing their United Kingdom foreign branch deposit agreements to make them payable both in the United Kingdom and the United States. This action has the potential to increase significantly the exposure of the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') and operational complexities were such deposits to be treated as insured. The purpose of this proposed rule is to preserve confidence in the FDIC deposit insurance system, ensure that the FDIC can effectively carry out its critical deposit insurance functions, and protect the DIF against the uncertain liability that it would otherwise face as a global deposit insurer. Should a United States bank make its foreign deposits dually payable, those deposits would be considered ``deposit liabilities'' under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act's (``FDI Act'') depositor preference regime, and would therefore be on an equal footing with domestic deposits in the event of the bank's liquidation.

A company that is predominantly engaged in such activities is a ``financial company'' for purposes of Title II of the Act (``Title II'') unless it is one of the few entities specifically excepted by the Act. A financial company, other than an insured depository institution, may be subject to Title II's orderly liquidation authority if, among other things, it is determined that the failure of the company and its resolution under otherwise applicable law would have serious adverse effects on financial stability in the United States.

Proposed Supervisory Guidance on Implementing Dodd-Frank Act Company-Run Stress Tests for Banking Organizations With Total Consolidated Assets of More Than $10 Billion But Less Than $50 Billion
The Board, FDIC and OCC, (collectively, the ``agencies'') are issuing this guidance, which outlines high-level principles for implementation of section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``DFA'') stress tests, applicable to all bank and savings-and-loan holding companies, national banks, state-member banks, state non-member banks, Federal savings associations, and state chartered savings associations with more than $10 billion but less than $50 billion in total consolidated assets (collectively, the ``$10-50 billion companies''). The guidance discusses supervisory expectations for DFA stress test practices and offers additional details about methodologies that should be employed by these companies. It also underscores the importance of stress testing as an ongoing risk management practice that supports a company's forward-looking assessment of its risks and better equips the company to address a range of macroeconomic and financial outcomes.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Standards for Certain Bank Holding Companies and Their Subsidiary Insured Depository Institutions
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on a proposal that would strengthen the agencies' leverage ratio standards for large, interconnected U.S. banking organizations. The proposal would apply to any U.S. top-tier bank holding company (BHC) with at least $700 billion in total consolidated assets or at least $10 trillion in assets under custody (covered BHC) and any insured depository institution (IDI) subsidiary of these BHCs. In the revised capital approaches adopted by the agencies in July, 2013 (2013 revised capital approaches), the agencies established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent (supplementary leverage ratio), consistent with the minimum leverage ratio adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for banking organizations subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules. In this notice of proposed rulemaking (proposal or proposed rule), the agencies are proposing to establish a ``well capitalized'' threshold of 6 percent for the supplementary leverage ratio for any IDI that is a subsidiary of a covered BHC, under the agencies' prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. The Board also proposes to establish a new leverage buffer for covered BHCs above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent (leverage buffer). The leverage buffer would function like the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based capital ratios in the 2013 revised capital approaches. A covered BHC that maintains a leverage buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2 percent of its total leverage exposure would not be subject to limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments. The proposal would take effect beginning on January 1, 2018. The agencies seek comment on all aspects of this proposal.

Removal of Transferred OTS Regulations Regarding Recordkeeping and Confirmation Requirements for Securities Transactions Effected by State Savings Associations and Other Amendments
In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') proposes to rescind and remove from the Code of Federal Regulations 12 CFR part 390, subpart K (``part 390, subpart K''), entitled ``Recordkeeping and Confirmation Requirements for Securities Transactions.'' This subpart was included in the regulations that were transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (``OTS'') on July 21, 2011, in connection with the implementation of applicable provisions of Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). With few exceptions addressed below, the requirements for State savings associations in part 390, subpart K, are substantively similar to those in FDIC's 12 CFR part 344 (``part 344''), which also is entitled ``Recordkeeping and Confirmation Requirements for Securities Transactions'' and is applicable to State nonmember insured banks and foreign banks having an insured branch. The FDIC proposes to amend the definition section of part 344 to clarifying that part 344 applies to all insured depository institutions, including State savings associations, for which the FDIC is the appropriate Federal banking agency. The FDIC also proposes to amend part 344 to increase the number of transactions that all FDIC- supervised institutions may effect on behalf of customers under the small transaction exception from certain of the recordkeeping requirements (``Small Transaction Exception''). Upon removal of part 390, subpart K, and with the proposed changes to part 344, the recordkeeping and confirmation requirements for securities transactions for customers effected by all insured depository institutions for which the FDIC has been designated the appropriate federal banking agency will be found at part 344.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Implementation of Basel III, Capital Adequacy, Transition Provisions, Prompt Corrective Action, Standardized Approach for Risk-weighted Assets, Market Discipline and Disclosure Requirements, Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, and Market Risk Capital Rule
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) is adopting an interim final rule that revises its risk-based and leverage capital requirements for FDIC-supervised institutions. This interim final rule is substantially identical to a joint final rule issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve) (together, with the FDIC, the agencies). The interim final rule consolidates three separate notices of proposed rulemaking that the agencies jointly published in the Federal Register on August 30, 2012, with selected changes. The interim final rule implements a revised definition of regulatory capital, a new common equity tier 1 minimum capital requirement, a higher minimum tier 1 capital requirement, and, for FDIC-supervised institutions subject to the advanced approaches risk-based capital rules, a supplementary leverage ratio that incorporates a broader set of exposures in the denominator. The interim final rule incorporates these new requirements into the FDIC's prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. In addition, the interim final rule establishes limits on FDIC-supervised institutions' capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments if the FDIC-supervised institution does not hold a specified amount of common equity tier 1 capital in addition to the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The interim final rule amends the methodologies for determining risk-weighted assets for all FDIC-supervised institutions. The interim final rule also adopts changes to the FDIC's regulatory capital requirements that meet the requirements of section 171 and section 939A of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The interim final rule also codifies the FDIC's regulatory capital rules, which have previously resided in various appendices to their respective regulations, into a harmonized integrated regulatory framework. In addition, the FDIC is amending the market risk capital rule (market risk rule) to apply to state savings associations. The FDIC is issuing these revisions to its capital regulations as an interim final rule. The FDIC invites comments on the interaction of this rule with other proposed leverage ratio requirements applicable to large, systemically important banking organizations. This interim final rule otherwise contains regulatory text that is identical to the common rule text adopted as a final rule by the Federal Reserve and the OCC. This interim final rule enables the FDIC to proceed on a unified, expedited basis with the other federal banking agencies pending consideration of other issues. Specifically, the FDIC intends to evaluate this interim final rule in the context of the proposed well- capitalized and buffer levels of the supplementary leverage ratio applicable to large, systemically important banking organizations, as described in a separate Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPR) published in the Federal Register August 20, 2013. The FDIC is seeking commenters' views on the interaction of this interim final rule with the proposed rule regarding the supplementary leverage ratio for large, systemically important banking organizations.

Deposit Insurance Regulations; Definition of Insured Deposit
The FDIC is adopting a final rule (``Final Rule'') that amends its deposit insurance regulations with respect to deposits in foreign branches of U.S. insured depository institutions (``IDI'' or ``U.S. bank''). The Final Rule clarifies that deposits in branches of U.S. banks located outside the United States are not FDIC-insured deposits. This would be the case even if they are also payable at an office within the United States (``dual payability''). As discussed further below, a pending proposal by the United Kingdom's Prudential Regulation Authority (``U.K. PRA''), formerly known as the Financial Services Authority, has made it more likely that large U.S. banks will change their U.K. foreign branch deposit agreements to make their U.K. deposits payable both in the United Kingdom and the United States. This action has the potential to expose the Deposit Insurance Fund (``DIF'') to expanded deposit insurance liability and create operational complexities if these types of deposits were treated as insured. The purpose of the Final Rule is to protect the DIF against the liability that it would otherwise face as a potential global deposit insurer, preserve confidence in the FDIC deposit insurance system, and ensure that the FDIC can effectively carry out its critical deposit insurance functions.

Credit Risk Retention

U.S.C. 78o-11), as added by section 941 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act). Section 15G generally requires the securitizer of asset-backed securities to retain not less than 5 percent of the credit risk of the assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities. Section 15G includes a variety of exemptions from these requirements, including an exemption for asset-backed securities that are collateralized exclusively by residential mortgages that qualify as ``qualified residential mortgages,'' as such term is defined by the agencies by rule.

Liquidity Coverage Ratio: Liquidity Risk Measurement, Standards, and Monitoring
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are requesting comment on a proposed rule (proposed rule) that would implement a quantitative liquidity requirement consistent with the liquidity coverage ratio standard established by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The requirement is designed to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of internationally active banking organizations, thereby improving the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, as well as improvements in the measurement and management of liquidity risk. The proposed rule would apply to all internationally active banking organizations, generally, bank holding companies, certain savings and loan holding companies, and depository institutions with more than $250 billion in total assets or more than $10 billion in on-balance sheet foreign exposure, and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The proposed rule would also apply to companies designated for supervision by the Board by the Financial Stability Oversight Council under section 113 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act that do not have significant insurance operations and to their consolidated subsidiaries that are depository institutions with $10 billion or more in total consolidated assets. The Board also is proposing on its own a modified liquidity coverage ratio standard that is based on a 21- calendar day stress scenario rather than a 30 calendar-day stress scenario for bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies without significant insurance or commercial operations that, in each case, have $50 billion or more in total consolidated assets.

Section 165(i) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (``Section 165(i)'') requires the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the ``FDIC'' or ``Corporation'') to issue regulations that mandate FDIC-insured state nonmember banks and FDIC-insured state-chartered savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion (``covered banks'') to conduct annual stress tests, report the results of such stress tests to the Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board of Governors''), and publish a summary of the results of the stress tests. On October 15, 2012, the FDIC published in the Federal Register a final rule implementing the requirements of Section 165(i) (the ``Stress Test Rule''). Under the Stress Test Rule covered banks are required to conduct annual stress tests using a minimum of three stress test scenarios (baseline, adverse, and severely adverse) provided by the FDIC. On November 20, 2012, the FDIC published in the Federal Register interim guidance setting forth the general processes and factors to be used by the FDIC in developing and distributing the stress test scenarios. The FDIC is now adopting the interim guidance as final without change, except for two technical corrections.

Removal of Transferred OTS Regulations Regarding Recordkeeping and Confirmation Requirements for Securities Transactions Effected by State Savings Associations and Other Amendments
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') is adopting a final rule (``Final Rule'') to rescind and remove a regulation entitled ``Recordkeeping and Confirmation Requirements for Securities Transactions,'' and to amend another regulation also entitled ``Recordkeeping and Confirmation Requirements for Securities Transactions.'' The rescinded regulation was one of several rules transferred to the FDIC following dissolution of the former Office of Thrift Supervision (``OTS'') in connection with the implementation of applicable provisions of Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). The Dodd-Frank Act provided that the former OTS rules that were transferred to the FDIC would be enforceable by or against the FDIC until they were modified, terminated, set aside, or superseded in accordance with applicable law by the FDIC, by any court of competent jurisdiction, or by operation of law. The FDIC received no comments on the Proposed Rule and consequently is adopting the Final Rule as proposed in the NPR without change. As a result, the recordkeeping and confirmation requirements for securities transactions effected on behalf of customers by all FDIC-supervised institutions will be found at the existing regulation entitled ``Recordkeeping and Confirmation Requirements for Securities Transactions.''.

Removal of Transferred OTS Regulations Regarding Disclosure and Reporting of CRA-Related Agreements and Amendments to Other Rules and Regulations
In this notice of proposed rulemaking, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') proposes to rescind and remove a regulation entitled ``Disclosure and Reporting of CRA-Related Agreements.'' This regulation was included in the regulations that were transferred to the FDIC from the Office of Thrift Supervision (``OTS'') on July 21, 2011, in connection with the implementation of applicable provisions of Title III of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (``Dodd-Frank Act''). The requirements for State savings associations in the rescinded regulation are substantively similar to those in another regulation also entitled ``Disclosure and Reporting of CRA-Related Agreements,'' which is applicable for all insured depository institutions (``IDIs'') for which the FDIC has been designated the appropriate Federal banking agency. Upon removal of the rescinded regulation entitled ``Disclosure and Reporting of CRA-Related Agreements,'' regulations applicable for all IDIs for which the FDIC has been designated the appropriate Federal banking agency will be found at the regulation also entitled ``Disclosure and Reporting of CRA-Related Agreements.''

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Proposed Revisions to the Supplementary Leverage Ratio
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are issuing a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed rule) that would revise the denominator of the supplementary leverage ratio (total leverage exposure) that the agencies adopted in July 2013 as part of comprehensive revisions to the agencies' regulatory capital rules (2013 revised capital rule). Specifically, the proposed rule would revise the treatment of on- and off-balance sheet exposures for purposes of determining total leverage exposure, and more closely align the agencies' rules on the calculation of total leverage exposure with international leverage ratio standards. The proposed rule would incorporate in total leverage exposure the effective notional principal amount of credit derivatives and other similar instruments through which a banking organization provides credit protection (sold credit protection), modify the calculation of total leverage exposure for derivatives and repo-style transactions, and revise the credit conversion factors (CCFs) applied to certain off- balance sheet exposures. The proposed rule also would make changes to the methodology for calculating the supplementary leverage ratio and to the public disclosure requirements for the supplementary leverage ratio. The proposed rule would apply to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies (banking organizations) that are subject to the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rules (advanced approaches banking organizations), as defined in the 2013 revised capital rule, including advanced approaches banking organizations that are subject to the enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards that the agencies have adopted in final form and published elsewhere in today's Federal Register (the eSLR standards). Consistent with the 2013 revised capital rule, advanced approaches banking organizations will be required to disclose their supplementary leverage ratios beginning January 1, 2015, and will be required to comply with a minimum supplementary leverage ratio capital requirement of 3 percent and, as applicable, the eSLR standards beginning January 1, 2018. The agencies are seeking comment on all aspects of the proposed rule.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Regulatory Capital, Enhanced Supplementary Leverage Ratio Standards for Certain Bank Holding Companies and Their Subsidiary Insured Depository Institutions
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are adopting a final rule that strengthens the agencies' supplementary leverage ratio standards for large, interconnected U.S. banking organizations (the final rule). The final rule applies to any U.S. top- tier bank holding company (BHC) with more than $700 billion in total consolidated assets or more than $10 trillion in assets under custody (covered BHC) and any insured depository institution (IDI) subsidiary of these BHCs (together, covered organizations). In the revised regulatory capital rule adopted by the agencies in July 2013 (2013 revised capital rule), the agencies established a minimum supplementary leverage ratio of 3 percent, consistent with the minimum leverage ratio adopted by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS), for banking organizations subject to the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rules. The final rule establishes enhanced supplementary leverage ratio standards for covered BHCs and their subsidiary IDIs. Under the final rule, an IDI that is a subsidiary of a covered BHC must maintain a supplementary leverage ratio of at least 6 percent to be well capitalized under the agencies' prompt corrective action (PCA) framework. The Board also is adopting in the final rule a supplementary leverage ratio buffer (leverage buffer) for covered BHCs of 2 percent above the minimum supplementary leverage ratio requirement of 3 percent. The leverage buffer functions like the capital conservation buffer for the risk-based capital ratios in the 2013 revised capital rule. A covered BHC that maintains a leverage buffer of tier 1 capital in an amount greater than 2 percent of its total leverage exposure is not subject to limitations on distributions and discretionary bonus payments under the final rule. Elsewhere in today's Federal Register, the agencies are proposing changes to the 2013 revised capital rule's supplementary leverage ratio, including changes to the definition of total leverage exposure, which would apply to all advanced approaches banking organizations and thus, if adopted, would affect banking organizations subject to this final rule.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, Proposed Revisions to the Definition of Eligible Guarantee
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are seeking comment on a notice of proposed rulemaking (proposed rule) that would revise the definition of eligible guarantee as incorporated into the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rule, adopted in the agencies' July 2013 regulatory capital rule (2013 capital rule). The agencies inadvertently limited the recognition of guarantees of wholesale exposures under the advanced approaches risk-based capital rule as incorporated into subpart E of the 2013 capital rule (advanced approaches). To address this matter, the proposed rule would remove the requirement that an eligible guarantee be made by an eligible guarantor for purposes of calculating the risk-weighted assets of an exposure (other than a securitization exposure) under the advanced approaches. The proposed change to the definition of eligible guarantee would apply to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies that are subject to the advanced approaches.

The OCC, Board, and FDIC (``we'' or ``Agencies'') are conducting a review of the regulations we have issued to identify outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome regulations for insured depository institutions. This review is required by section 2222 of the Economic Growth and Regulatory Paperwork Reduction Act of 1996 (``EGRPRA''). To facilitate this review, the Agencies have divided these regulations into 12 subject-matter categories and identified the regulations within each category. At regular intervals over the next two years, the Agencies will publish four Federal Register requests for comment. Each will address one or more categories. We will invite the public to identify the regulations in each category that they believe are outdated, unnecessary, or unduly burdensome for insured depository institutions and their regulated holding companies. This is the first of the four Federal Register requests for comment. In it, we are seeking comment on the regulations in the following three categories: Applications and Reporting, Powers and Activities, and International Operations. We will address the remaining nine categories in the three subsequent requests for comment. To aid the public, we also are publishing a chart that sets forth the rules addressed in this document, as well as those that we will address in the remaining three.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the ``Corporation'' or ``FDIC'') requests comment on this proposed rule that revises FDIC Rules and Regulations regarding the annual stress testing requirements for state non-member banks and state savings associations with total consolidated assets of more than $10 billion (``covered banks''). Our regulations, which implement section 165(i)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act''), requires covered banks to conduct annual stress tests and report the results of such stress test to the Corporation and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (``Board'') and publicly disclose a summary of the results of the required stress tests. The FDIC proposes to modify the ``as-of'' dates for financial data (that covered banks will use to perform their stress tests) as well as the reporting dates and public disclosure dates of the annual stress tests for both $10 billion to $50 billion covered banks and $50 billion covered banks. The revisions to our regulations would become effective January 1, 2016.

Assessments
The FDIC is proposing: To revise the ratios and ratio thresholds for capital evaluations used in its risk-based deposit insurance assessment system to conform to the prompt corrective action capital ratios and ratio thresholds adopted by the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; to revise the assessment base calculation for custodial banks to conform to the asset risk weights adopted by the FDIC, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency; and to require all highly complex institutions to measure counterparty exposure for deposit insurance assessment purposes using the Basel III standardized approach credit equivalent amount for derivatives and the Basel III standardized approach exposure amount for other securities financing transactions, such as repo-style transactions, margin loans and similar transactions, as adopted by the Federal banking agencies. These changes are intended to accommodate recent changes to the Federal banking agencies' capital rules that are referenced in portions of the assessments regulation.

Regulatory Capital Rules: Advanced Approaches Risk-Based Capital Rule, Revisions to the Definition of Eligible Guarantee
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) (collectively, the agencies) are adopting a final rule that revises the definition of eligible guarantee in the agencies' advanced approaches risk-based capital rule, adopted in the agencies' July 2013 regulatory capital rule (2013 capital rule). The final rule removes the requirement that an eligible guarantee be made by an eligible guarantor for purposes of calculating the risk- weighted assets of an exposure (other than a securitization exposure) under the advanced approaches risk-based capital rule as incorporated into the 2013 capital rule (advanced approaches). The change to the definition of eligible guarantee applies to all banks, savings associations, bank holding companies, and savings and loan holding companies that are subject to the advanced approaches.

Transferred OTS Regulations Regarding Possession by Conservators and Receivers for Federal and State Savings Associations.
On July 21, 2014, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) caused a document entitled ``Transferred OTS Regulations Regarding Possession by Conservators and Receivers for Federal and State Savings Associations'' to be published in the Federal Register. The effect of this publication was to give notice of a proposed rulemaking to rescind and remove regulations regarding possession by conservators and receivers for federal and state savings associations, which are no longer necessary in light of or contradict provisions of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and are not in accordance with FDIC practice and procedures. It has come to the attention of FDIC that the document submitted to the Federal Register was an early draft of the notice and not the final version approved by FDIC Board of Directors. FDIC is, therefore, withdrawing the document published July 21, 2014, and publishing the correct version elsewhere in the Federal Register today.
